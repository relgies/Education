    <li>Remote-procedure calls (RPCs) behave similarly to which of the following?
        <ol type='a'>
            <li>Synchronous API
            <li>Asynchronous API
        </ol>
        <br />
        <details>
            <summary><strong><i>Answers</i></strong></summary>
            A.  RPCs are blocked during the waiting periods.  Once a procedure is executed and the response is sent from the server and received on the client, the execution of the procedure continues.  This is similar to a synchronous API.
