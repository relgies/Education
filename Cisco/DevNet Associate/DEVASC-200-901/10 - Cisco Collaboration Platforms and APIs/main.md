#   Introduction to the Cisco Collaboration Portfolio

&nbsp;

Cisco's collaboration portfolio is vast, but it can be logically broken down into essentially four high-level components:

-   **Unified Communications Manager**:  This product unifies voice, video, data, and mobile apps.
-   **Unified Contact Center**:  This product provides customers with personalized omnichannel experiences.
-   **Cisco Webex**:  This conferencing solution enables teamwork with intuitive solutions that bring people together.
-   **Cisco collaboration endpoints**:  These devices provide better-than-being-there experiences via new devices.

&nbsp;

Figure 10-1 depicts the Cisco collaboration portfolio and the various products that fall into each of the categories.

&nbsp;

**Figure 10-1** *Rich Collaboration Portfolio*

>   It's a tree.  At the top is COLLABORATION with four branches beneath it.  From left to right we first have UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS which has WEBEX TEAMS, CISCO UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS MANAGER, and CLOUD CALLING underneath it.  Next we have CONTACT CENTER which has CISCO UNIFIED Contact Center and WEBEX Contact Center beneath it.  Then we have CONFERENCING with WEBEX MEETINGS and WEBEX EVENTS beneath it.  Finally there is ENDPOINTS, which has WEBEX BOARD, WEBEX ROOMS, CISCO IP PHONES, and WEBEX SHARE beneath it.  Below is an example of this tree hierarchy.

&nbsp;

## Unified Communications

&nbsp;

~~People work together in different ways.  and they use a lot of collaboration tools; IP telephony for voice calling, web and video conferencing, voicemail, mobility, desktop sharing, instant messaging and presence, and more.~~

&nbsp;

Cisco Unified communications solutions deliver seamless user experiences that help people work together more effectively - anywhere and on any device.  They bring real-time communication from your phone system and conferencing solutions together with messaging and chat and integrate with everyday business applications using APIs.

&nbsp;

Unified Communications solutions are available as on-premises software, as partner-hosted solutions, and as a service (UCaaS) from cloud providers.

&nbsp;

The following sections describe the products available under the Unified Communications umbrella.

&nbsp;

## Cisco Webex Teams

&nbsp;

~~Cisco Webex Teams brings people and work together in a single reimagined workspace in and beyond the meeting.  Wewbex Teams allows you to connect with people (inside and outside your organization) and places all your tools right in the center of your workflow.  It breaks down the silos that exist for some across the collaboration experience.~~

&nbsp;

Both Webex Teams and Webex Meetings have a Join button you can click to easily join a meeting.  This helps ensure that meetings start on time and it streamlines the process of joining a meeting.  Cisco Webex Teams also has features that will help you make decisions on which meetings to prioritize and when to join then:

-   **Seeing invitee status/participants**:  Every invitee can see who has accepted/declined the meeting and who's in the meeting live before even joining.  There is no need to switch back and forth between your calendar and the meeting application.
-   **Instantly switching between meetings**:  If you need to move from one meeting to another, simply leave the meeting with one click and join the other one with another click.
-   **Easily informing attendees when you are running late**:  In Webex Teams, you can message people in the meeting to keep them posted on your status.  ~~Gone are the days of sending an email that no one will read because they are in the meeting.~~

&nbsp;

Webex Teams provides a space for a team to start working - to discuss issues and share content - before a meeting.  When the meeting starts, all the discussion and work from before the meeting are available right there in the meeting space.  You can simply share content from any device in the meeting - directly from the space or from another device, wirelessly and quickly.

&nbsp;

An added benefit of joining a meeting through Webex Teams is that during the meeting, everyone is an equal participant and can mute noisy participants and record the meeting, and do other meeting management tasks without having to disrupt the flow of the meeting.

&nbsp;

## Cisco Webex Calling

&nbsp;

Webex Calling is a cloud-based phone system that is optimized for midsize businesses and provides the essential business calling capabilities you are likely to need.  With Webex Calling, there's no need to worry about the expensive and complexity of managing phone system infrastructure on your premises anymore.  Cisco takes care of the Webex Cloud so you can focus on what matters most.

&nbsp;

You can choose from a wide range of Cisco IP phones to make and receive calls.  Enjoy the calling features you are used to from a traditional phone system to help run your organization smoothly and never miss a call.  If you are a mobile worker, or if you are out of the office, you can make and receive calls on your smartphone, computer, or tablet, using the Cisco Webex Teams app.  

&nbsp;

Webex Calling seamlessly integrates with Webex Teams and Webex Meetings, so you can take the collaboration inside and outside your organization to a new level.  Customers and business partners can make high-definition audio and video calls from the office, from home, or on the go.  Screen sharing, file sharing, real-time messaging, and whiteboarding can turn any call into a productive meeting.  You can also add Cisco Webex Board, Room, or Desk Device to get the most out of Webex Teams and Meetings and improve teamwork.

&nbsp;

Cisco Webex Calling delivers all the features of a traditional PBX through a monthly subscription service.  Important qualities include the following:

-   An advanced set of enterprise-grade PBX features
-   A rich user experience that includes the cisco Webex Calling app, for mobile and desktop users, integrated with the Cisco Webex Teams collaboration app
-   Support for an integrated user experience with Cisco Webex Meetings and Webex Devices, including Cisco IP Phones 6800, 7800, and 8800 Series desk phones and analog ATAs.
-   Delivery from a set of regionally distributed, geo-redundant data centers around the globe
-   Service that is available across a growing list of countries in every region
-   Protection of existing investment in any on-premises Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) license, through Cisco Collaboration Flex Plan
-   A smooth migration to the cloud at your pace, through support of cloud and mixed cloud and on-premises deployments

&nbsp;

## Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM)

&nbsp;

Cisco Unified CM, often informally referred to as ***Call Manager***, is the core of Cisco's collaboration portfolio.  It delivers people-centric user and administrative experiences and supports a full range of collaboration services, including video, voice, instant messaging and presence, messaging, and mobility on Cisco as well as third-party devices.  Unified CM is the industry leader in enterprise call and session management platforms, with more than 300,000 customers worldwide and more than 120 million Cisco IP phones and soft clients deployed.

&nbsp;

## Unified Contact Center

&nbsp;

The Cisco Unified Contact Center (Unified CC), also called Finesse, is a next-generation desktop that is designed to provide the optimal user experience for agents.  It is 100% browser based, so agent client machines do not need any Unified CC-specific applications.  Cisco Finesse is a next-generation agent and supervisor desktop designed to provide a collaborative experience for the various communities that interact with a customer service organization.  It also helps improve the customer experience and offers a user-centric design to enhance customer care representative satisfaction.

&nbsp;

Cisco Finesse provides the following:

-   An agent and supervisor desktop that integrates traditional contact center functions into a thin-client desktop.
-   A 100% browser-based desktop implemented through a Web 2.0 interface; no client-side installations are required.
-   A single customizable interface that gives customer care provides quick and easy access to multiple assets and information sources.
-   Open Web 2.0 APIs that simplify the development and integration of value-added applications and minimize the need for detailed desktop development expertise.

&nbsp;

## Cisco Webex

&nbsp;

Cisco Webex is a conferencing solution that allows people to collaborate more effectively with each other anytime, anywhere, and from any device.  Webex online meetings are truly engaging with high-definition video.  Webex makes online meetings easy and productive with features such as document, application, and desktop sharing; integrated audio/video; active speaker detection; recording; and machine learning features.

&nbsp;

## Cisco Collaboration Endpoints

&nbsp;

To support and empower the modern workforce, Cisco has a "no-compromise" collaboration solution for every room, on every desk, in every pocket, and into every application.  Its portfolio of collaboration devices include everything from voice to collaboration room devices for small businesses to very large enterprises.  The majority of the portfolio has been redesigned to make collaboration more affordable, accessible, and easy to use.  Many Cisco collaboration endpoints have received the Red Dot Award for excellence in design.

&nbsp;

The Cisco collaboration endpoint portfolio includes the following devices:

-   **Room-based devices**:  These include video system or codec in the Cisco TelePresence MX Series, SX, and DX Series.
-   **Cisco Webex Board**:  Cisco Webex Board allows you to wirelessly present whiteboard and video or audio conference for team collaboration.
-   **Webex Share**:  The new Webex Share device allows easy, one-click wireless screen sharing from the Webex Teams software client to any external display with an HDMI port.
-   **Collaboration desktop video devices**:  A range of options are available, from entry-level HD video up to the lifelike DX video collaboration devices.
-   **IP Phone portfolio**:  Cisco IP Phone devices deliver superior voice communications, with select endpoints supporting HD video and a range of options that offer choices for businesses of various sizes and with unique needs and budgets.  The complete portfolio also supports specialty use cases, such as in-campus wireless with WLAN handsets and an audio-conferencing endpoint for small to large conference rooms.  The goal of the IP Phone portfolio is to deliver the highest-quality audio communications with affordable, scalable options for desktop video that are easy to use and administer so you can collaborate effectively and achieve your desired business results.
-   **Cisco Headset 500 Series**:  These headsets deliver surprisingly vibrant sound for open workspaces.  Now users can stay focused in noisy environments with rich sound, exception comfort, and proven reliability.  The headsets offer a lightweight form factor designed for workers who spend a lot of time collaborating in contact centers and open workspaces.  With the USB headset adapter, the 500 Series delivers an enhanced experience, including automatic software upgrades, in-call presence indicator, and audio customizations that allow you to adjust how you hear the far end and how they hear you.

&nbsp;

Cisco now provides more intelligent audio, video, and usability, offering new ways for users to bring their personal devices, such as smartphones or tablets, into a phone or video meeting to further enhance the collaboration experience.

&nbsp;

## API Options in the Cisco Collaboration Portfolio

&nbsp;

The Cisco collaboration portfolio is rich in features.  APIs are used to integrate and scale these products in building various applications.  The following sections cover four categories of collaboration APIs:

-   Webex Meetings API
-   Webex Teams
-   Contact Center (Finesse)
-   Endpoints

&nbsp;

#  Webex Teams API

&nbsp;

>   ***`Key Topic`***

&nbsp;

Webex Teams makes it easy for everyone on a team to be in sync.  Conversations in Webex Teams take place in virtual meeting rooms called ***spaces***.  Some spaces live for a few hours, while others become permanent fixtures of a team's workflow.  Webex Teams allows conversations to flow seamlessly between massages, video calls, and real-time whiteboarding sessions.

&nbsp;

Getting started with the Webex APIs is easy.  These APIs allow developers to build integrations and bots for Webex Teams.  APIs also allow administrators to perform administrative tasks.

&nbsp;

Webex APIs provide applications with direct access to the Cisco Webex platform, giving you the ability to do the following:

-   Administer the Webex Teams platform for an organization, add user accounts, and so on
-   Create a Webex teams team, space, and memberships
-   Search for people in the company
-   Post messages in a Webex teams space
-   Get Webex Teams space history or be notified in real time when new messages are posted by others

&nbsp;

Figure 10-2 shows an overall picture of how Webex Teams is organized.  Only an admin has the ability to add a new organization or a new user account for the organization.  An organization is made up of teams, and a team can have one or more rooms.  A person is an end user who can be added to a room.  People communicate with each other or with everyone else in a room via messages.

&nbsp;

**Figure 10-2** *Webex Teams Building Blocks: Organizations, Teams, Rooms, People, and Messages*

>   It's a tree structure.  At the top is Organization 1.  The first branch is on the left which is Team 1 and next to it is Team 2.  From Team 1 there are two branches, the first being on the left which is Room 1 with Room 2 next to it.  Room 1 has arrows labeled "Message" point to multiple "Person" objects as under Room 1 as well as a person under Room 2. 

&nbsp;

## API Authentication

&nbsp;

There are four ways to access the Webex teams APIs:

-   Personal access tokens
-   Integrations
-   Bots
-   Guest issuers

&nbsp;

The Webex Representational State Transfer (REST) API uses the Cisco Webex Common Identity (CI) account.  Once you create an account to join Webex Teams, you have access to the Common Identity account, which allows you to use the APIs and SDKs.

&nbsp;

## Personal Access Tokens

&nbsp;

When making requests to the Webex REST API, an authentication HTTP header is used to identify the requesting user.  This header must include an access token, which may be a personal access token from the developer site (https://developer.webex.com), a bot token, or an OAuth token from the integration or a guest issuer application.  The API reference uses your personal access token, which you can use to interact with the Webex API as yourself.  This token has a short lifetime - it lasts only 12 hours after logging in to the site - so it shouldn't be used outside of app development.  Figure 10-3 shows the bearer token as obtained from the developer portal.

&nbsp;

**Figure 10-3** *Webex Teams: Getting a Personal Access Token*

>   Underneath REST API > Getting Started page there is a "Your Personal Access Token" area which states the Bearer token that is hidden with the options to copy it.

&nbsp;

## Integrations

&nbsp;

To perform actions on behalf of someone else, you need a separate access token that you obtained through an OAuth authorization grant flow.  OAuth is supported directly into the platform.  With a few easy steps, you can have a Webex Teams user granted permission to your app and perform actions on that person's behalf.  Figure 10-4 shows how third-party apps can access the platform.

&nbsp;

**Figure 10-4** *Webex Teams: Third-Party Integrations*

>   On the left there is a long block that says "3rd Party App" and on the right there is a long block that says "Webex Teams".  Between them there are blocks that show the flow.  At the top from 3rd Party App to Webex Teams there is a REQUEST of "Get Me a List of Available Rooms".  Then Webex Teams sends a RESPONSE of "Here's the List" back to 3rd Party App.  The 3rd Party App then sends a POST of Message - "Alert Build Complete" to Webex Teams.

&nbsp;

You use an integration to request permission to invoke the Webex REST API on behalf of another Webex Teams user.  To provide security, the API supports the OAuth 2 standard, which allows a third-party integration to get a temporary access token for authenticating API calls instead of asking users for their password.

&nbsp;

Here are a few easy steps to get started using an integration:

-   **Step 1**.  Register an integration with Webex Teams at https://developer.webex.com/my-apps/new.
-   **Step 2**.  Request permission by using an OAuth grant flow by invoking the flow via https://webexapis.com/v1/authorize and providing a redirect URL to come back to.
-   **Step 3**.  Click Accept to obtain the authorization code for an access token.

&nbsp;

The redirect URL contains a code parameter in the query string like so:

`https://0.0.0.0:8080/?code=NzAwMGUyZDUtYjcxMS00YWM4LTg3ZDYtNzdhMDhhNWRjZGY5NGFmMjA3ZjEtYzRk_PF84_1eb65fdf-9643-417f-9974-ad72cae0e10f&state=set_state_here`

&nbsp;

>   ***`Key Topic`***

&nbsp;

## Access Scopes

&nbsp;

Scopes define the level of access that an integration requires.  Each integration alerts the end user with the scope of the integration.  Scopes determine what resources the Access Token has access to.  Table 10-2 lists and describes the scopes.

&nbsp;

**Table 10-2** Webex Teams and Scopes API Definitions

| Scope | Description |
| -- | -- |
| permission dialog.spark:all | Full access to your Webex Teams account |
| spark:people_read | Read your company directory |
| spark:rooms_read | List the title of rooms that you're in |
| spark:rooms_write | Manage rooms on your behalf |
| spark:memberships_read | List the people in rooms that you're in |
| spark:memberships_write | Invite people to rooms on your behalf |
| spark:messages_read | Read the content of rooms that you're in |
| spark:messages_write | Post and delete messages on your behalf |
| spark:teams_read | List the teams you are a member of |
| spark:teams_write | Manage teams on your behalf |
| spark:team_memberships_read | List the people in the teams that you are in |
| spark:team_memberships_write | Add people to teams on your behalf |
| spark:webhooks_read | See all webhooks created on your behalf |
| spark:webhooks_write | Modify or delete webhooks created on your behalf |

&nbsp;

The following sections examine some of the APIs you can use to create rooms, add people, and send messages in a room.

&nbsp;

## Organizations API 

&nbsp;

An organization is a set of people in Webex Teams.  Organizations may manage other organizations or may be managed themselves.  The organizations API can be access only by an administrator.  Table 10-3 shows the methods used with Organizations API to get details about organizations.

&nbsp;

**Table 10-3** Webex Teams: Organization API

| Method | API | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| GET | `https://webexapis.com/v1/organizations` | List all the organizations |
| GET | `https://webexapis.com/v1/organizations{orgId}` | Get details about an organization |

&nbsp;

>  **Note**
>
>  The hostname https://api.ciscospark.com has now been changed to https://webexapis.com.  The old https://api.ciscospark.com will continue to work.

&nbsp;

### Teams API 

&nbsp;

A team is a group of people with a set of rooms that is visible to all members of that team.  The Teams API is used to manage teams - to create, delete, and rename teams.  Table 10-4 lists the various operations that can be performed on the Teams API.

&nbsp;

**Table 10-4** Webex Teams: Teams API

| Method | API | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| GET | `https://webexapis.com/v1/teams` | List all teams |
| POST | `https://webexapis.com/v1/teams` | Create a new team |
| GET | `https://webexapis.com/v1/teams/{teamId}` | Get details about a particular team |
| PUT | `https://webexapis.com/v1/teams/{teamId}` | Update details about a team |
| DELETE | `https://webexapis.com/v1/teams/{teamId}` | Delete a team |

&nbsp;

For example, say that you want to use the Teams API to create a new team named DevNet Associate Certification Room.  To do so, you use the POST method and the API https://webexapis.com/v1/teams.

&nbsp;

You can use a Python request to make the REST call.  Example 10-1 shows a Python script that sends a POST request to create a new team.  It initializes variables such as the base URL, the payload, and the headers, and it calls the request.

&nbsp;

Example 10-1 *Python code to Create a New Team*

```python
""" Create Webex Team """

import json
import requests

URL = "https://webexapis.com/v1/teams"
PAYLOAD = {
 
    "name": "DevNet Associate Certification Team"
}
HEADERS = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer MDA0Y2VlMzktNDc2Ni00NzI5LWFiNmYtZmNmYzM3OTkyNjMxNmI0ND-VmNDktNGE1_PF84_consumer",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
RESPONSE = requests.request("POST", URL, data=json.dumps(PAYLOAD), headers=HEADERS)
print(RESPONSE.text)
```

&nbsp;

## Rooms API

&nbsp;

Rooms are virtual meeting places where people post messages and collaborate to get work done.  The Rooms API is used to manage rooms - to create, delete, and rename them.  Table 10-5 lists the operations that can be performed with the Room API.

&nbsp;

**Table 10-5** Webex Teams: Rooms API

| Method | API | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| GET | `https://webexapis.com/v1/rooms` | List all the rooms | 
| POST | `https://webexapis.com/v1/rooms` | Create a new room |
| GET | `https://webexapis.com/v1/rooms/{roomId}` | Get room details |
| GET | `https://webexapis.com/v1/rooms/{roomId}/meetingInfo` | Get room meeting details |
| PUT | `https://webexapis.com/v1/rooms/{roomId}` | Update room details |
| DELETE | `https://webexapis.com/v1/rooms/{roomId}` | Delete a room |

&nbsp;

You can use the Rooms API to create a room.  When you do, an authenticated user is automatically added as a member of the room.  To create a room, you can use the POST method and the API `https://webexapis.com/v1/rooms`.

&nbsp;

Example 10-2 shows Python request code that creates a room with the name DevAsc Team Room.  It initializes variables such as the base URL, the payload, and the headers, and it calls the request.  The header consists of the bearer token of the authenticated user or the integration along with other parameters.

&nbsp;

**Example 10-2** *Python Request to Create a New Room*

```python
import json
import requests
import pprint

URL = "https://webexapis.com/v1/rooms"
PAYLOAD = {
    "title": "DevAsc Team Room"
}
HEADERS = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer MDA0Y2VlMzktNDc2Ni00NzI5LWFiNmYtZmNmYzM3OTkyNjMxNmI0ND-VmNDktNGE1_PF84_consumer",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
RESPONSE = requests.request("POST", URL, data=json.dumps(PAYLOAD), headers=HEADERS)
pprint.pprint(json.loads(RESPONSE.text))
```

&nbsp;

Example 10-3 shows the response to creating a room.  The response includes the creation time and owner, along with the ID, which can be used in subsequent calls.

&nbsp;

**Example 10-3** *Response to the Successful Creation of a Room*

```
$ python3 CreateRoom.py
{'created': '2020-02-15T23:13:35.578Z',
 'creatorId': 'Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3VzL1BFT1BMRS8wYWZmMmFhNC1mN2IyLTQ3MWU-
 tYTIzMi0xOTEyNDgwYmDEADB',
 'id': 'Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3VzL1JPT00vY2FhMzJiYTAtNTA0OC0xMWVhLWJiZWItYmY1MWQyNGRm
 MTU0',
 'isLocked': False,
 'lastActivity': '2020-02-15T23:13:35.578Z',
 'ownerId': 'consumer',
 'title': 'DevAsc Team Room',
 'type': 'group'}
$
```

&nbsp;

You can use the Rooms API to get a list of all the rooms that have been created.  To do so, you can use the GET method and the API `https://webexapis.com/v1/rooms`.

&nbsp;

Example 10-4 shows how to use the **curl** command to make the REST call.  This script sends a GET request to list all rooms that a particular user belongs to.

&nbsp;

**Example 10-4** ***curl** Script for Getting a List of All Rooms*

```
$ curl -X GET \
  https://webexapis.com/v1/rooms \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer DeadBeefMTAtN2UzZi00YjRiLWIzMGEtMThjMzliNWQwZGEyZTljN-
  WQxZTktNTRl_PF84_1eb65fdf-9643-417f-9974-ad72cae0e10f'  
```

&nbsp;

## Memberships API

&nbsp;

A membership represents a person's relationship to a room.  You can use the Memberships API to list members of any room that you're in or create memberships to invite someone to a room.  Memberships can also be updated to make someone a moderator or deleted to remove someone from the room.  Table 10-6 lists the operations that can be performed with respect ot the Memberships API, such as listing memberships and adding a new member.

&nbsp;

**Table 10-6** Webex teams: Memberships API

| Method | API | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| GET | `https://webexapis.com/v1/memberships` | List memberships |
| POST | `https://webexapis.com/v1/memberships` | Add a new member |
| GET | `https://webexapis.com/v1/memberships/{membershipId}` | Get details about a member |
| PUT | `https://webexapis.com/v1/memberships/{membershipId}` | Update details about a member |
| DELETE | `https://webexapis.com/v1/memberships/{membershipId}` | Delete a member |

&nbsp;

You can use the Memberships API to add a new member to a given room (that is, create a new membership) by using the POST method and the API `https://webexapis.com/v1/memberships`.

&nbsp;

You can use Python to make a REST call.  Example 10-5 shows a **curl** script that sends a POST request to add a new member with email-id newUser@devasc.com to the room.

&nbsp;

**Example 10-5** *Python Script to Add a New Member to a Room*

```python
""" Add new Member to a Webex Room """

import json
import requests
import pprint

URL = "https://webexapis.com/v1/memberships"
PAYLOAD = {
    "roomId" : "Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3VzL1JPT00vY2FhMzJiYTAtNTA0OC0xMWVhLWJiZ-WItYmY1MWQyNGRDEADB",
    "personEmail": "newUser@devasc.com",
    "personDisplayName": "Cisco DevNet",
    "isModerator": "false"
}
HEADERS = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer MDA0Y2VlMzktNDc2Ni00NzI5LWFiNmYtZmNmYzM3OTkyNjMxNmI0ND-
    VmNDktNGE1_PF84_consumer",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
RESPONSE = requests.request("POST", URL, data=json.dumps(PAYLOAD), headers=HEADERS)
pprint.pprint(json.loads(RESPONSE.text))
```

&nbsp;

## Messages API

&nbsp;

Messages are communications that occur in a room.  In Webex teams, each message is displayed on its own line, along with a timestamp and sender information.  You can use the Messages API to list, create, and delete messages.

&nbsp;

Messages can contain plaintext, rich text, and a file attachment.  Table 10-7 shows the API for sending messages to Webex Teams.

&nbsp;

**Table 10-8** Webex Teams: Message API

&nbsp;

| Method | API | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| GET | `https://webexapis.com/v1/messages` | List messages |
| GET | `https://webexapis.com/v1/messages/direct` | List one-to-one messages |
| POST | `https://webexapis.com/v1/messages` | Post a new message |
| GET | `https://webexapis.com/v1/messages/{messageId}` | Get details about a message |
| DELETE | `https://webexapis.com/v1/messages/{messageId}` | Delete a message |

&nbsp;

You can use the Messages API to add a new message to a given room (that is, create a new message).  To do so, you use the POST method and the API `https://webexapis.com/v1/messages`.

&nbsp;

You can use a Python request to make a REST call.  Example 10-6 shows a Python script that sends a POST message to add a new message to a particular room.

&nbsp;

**Example 10-6** *Python Script to Add a New Message to a Room*

```python
""" Send Webex Message """

import json
import requests
import pprint

URL = "https://webexapis.com/v1/messages"
PAYLOAD = {
    "roomId" : "Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3VzL1JPT00vY2FhMzJiYTAtNTA0OC0xMWVhLWJiZ-WItYmY1MWQyNGRmMTU0",
    "text" : "This is a test message"
}
HEADERS = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer NDkzODZkZDUtZDExNC00ODM5LTk0YmYtZmY4NDI0ZTE5ZDA1MGI-
    5YTY3OWUtZGYy_PF84_consumer",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
}
RESPONSE = requests.request("POST", URL, da
```

&nbsp;

## Bots

&nbsp;

A ***bot*** (short for chatbot) is a piece of code or an application that simulates a human conversation.  Users communicate with a bot via the chat interface or by voice, just as they would talk to a real person.  Bots help users automate tasks, bring external content into the discussion, and gain efficiencies.  Webex Teams has a rich set of APIs that make it very easy and simple for any developer to add a bot to any Teams room.  In Webex, bots are similar to regular Webex Teams users.  They can participate in one-to-one and group spaces, and users can message them directly or add them to a group space.  A special badge is added to a bot's avatar in the Webex Teams client so users know they're interacting with a bot instead of a human.

&nbsp;

A bot can only access messages sent to it directly.  In group spaces, bots must be @mentioned to access a message.  In one-to-one spaces, a bot has access to all messages from the user.  Bots are typically of the three types described in Table 10-8.

&nbsp;

>   ***`Key Topic`***

&nbsp;

**Table 10-8** Bot Types

| Type | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Notification bot | Events from external services are brought in and posted in Webex Teams.  Examples of events include build complete, retail, inventory, status, and temperature today. |
| Controller bot | External systems that have APIs allow third-party apps to be integrated to control them.  For example, you could control turning lights on or off by invoking a lights bot. |
| Assistance bot | Virtual assistants usually understand natural language, so a user can ask questions of bots as they would ask humans (for example, "@Merakibot, how many wifi devices are currently on floor 2?") |

&nbsp;

## Bot Frameworks and Tools

&nbsp;

There are several bot frameworks that cna greatly simplify the bot development process by abstracting away the low-level communications with the Webex REST API, such as creating and sending API requests and configuring webhooks.  You can focus on building the interaction and business logic of a bot.  These are two popular bot frameworks:

-   Flint:  Flint is an open-source bot framework with support for regex pattern matching for messages and more.
-   Botkit:  Botkit is a popular open-source bot framework with advanced conversational support as well as integrations with a comprehensive array of natural language processing and storage providers.

&nbsp;

One of the greatest starting points for learning about and creating your own bots for Webex Teams is the DevNet Code Exchange, at https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/github/repo/howdyai/botkit.

&nbsp;

## Guest Issuer 

&nbsp;

Guest issuer applications give guest users temporary access to users within the organization.  Guest issuers can be created at https://developer.webex.com/my-apps/new/guest-issuer.  To create a new guest issuer, the only thing that is required is the name.  A new guest issuer ID and shared secret will be generated and can be used subsequently.  The main reason to use a guest issuer is to interact with users who do not have a Webex Teams account.  These users might be visitors to a website who you'd like to message with over Webex Teams.  Or they might be customers in a store with which you'd like to have a video call.  These guest users can interact with a regular Webex Teams users via tokens generated by a guest issuer application.

&nbsp;

Guest users of Webex Teams authenticate by using guest tokens.  Guest tokens us the ***JSON Web Token (JWT)*** standard to create and share authentication credentials between SDKs and widgets and the Webex REST API.  These tokens are exchanged for an access authentication token that can be used for a limited time and limited purpose to interact with regular Webex Teams users.

&nbsp;

Each guest token should be associated with an individual user of an application.  The guest's activity within Webex Teams, such as message activity or call history, will persist, just as it would for a regular Webex Teams user.  While guest users can interact with regular Webex Teams users, they are not allowed to interact with other guests.  Example 10-7 shows a Python code snippet that creates a JWT token from the guest issuer ID and secret and passes it in the authentication headers.  It is then possible to use any of the APIs to interact with other users in the system.

&nbsp;


**Example 10-7** *Python Code to Generate a JWT Token for a Guest Issuer*

```python
""" Generate JWT """

import base64
import time
import math
import jwt

EXPIRATION = math.floor(time.time()) + 3600 # 1 hour from now
 
PAYLOAD = {
    "sub": "devASC",
    "name": "devASC-guest",
    "iss": "GUEST_ISSUER_ID",
    "exp": EXPIRATION
}

SECRET = base64.b64decode('GUEST_ISSUE_SECRET')

TOKEN = jwt.encode(PAYLOAD, SECRET)

print(TOKEN.decode('utf-8'))
HEADERS = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + TOKEN.decode('utf-8')
}
```

&nbsp;

## Webex Teams SDKs

&nbsp;

As of this writing, there is a variety of SDKs available; some of them official Webex teams SDKs, and others are from the community.  The following is a selection of the Webex Teams SDKs that are available:

-   **Go (go-cisco-Webex-teams)**:  A Go client library (by jbogarin)

# Cisco Finesse

&nbsp;

The cisco Finesse desktop is a call agent and supervisor desktop solution designed to meet the growing needs of agents, supervisors, and the administrators and developers who support them.  The Cisco Finesse desktop runs in a browsers, which means you install Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX), and agents start by simply typing in the URL for the Unified CCX server.  The desktop is more than an agent state and call-control application.  It is an OpenSocial gadget container, built to include third-party applications in a single agent desktop experience.  Rather than switching between applications, agents have easy access to all applications and tools from a single window, which increases their efficiency.  Figure 10-9 shows the architecture and high-level flow of Finesse, which involves the following steps:

&nbsp;

>   ***`Key Topic`***

&nbsp;

**Figure 10-9** *Finesse High-Level Flow*

![Figure 10-9 Finesse High-Level Flow!](assets/images/Figure%2010-9%20Finesse%20High-Level%20Flow.jpeg)

&nbsp;

-   **Step 1**.  The call arrives from either the PSTN or a VoIP connection to the gateway.
-   **Step 2**.  The gateway then hands over the call to Unified CM, which invokes the application that was preregistered.  In this case, it is handled by Unified CCX
-   **Step 3**.  Unified CM notifies the Unified CCX about the incoming call via JTAPI.
-   **Step 4**.  After consulting the resource manager ( routing the call to the agent based on skills, priority, and rebalancing), Unified CCX notifies Finesse via computer telephony integration (CTI) connection.
-   **Step 5**.  Finesse performs internal processing and then publishes a notification to Notification Service.
-   **Step 6**.  The Finesse desktop receives this notification from Notification Service via the Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP (BOSH) connection (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol [XMPP]).
-   **Step 7**.  The agent makes a request to perform an operation (such as answer a call); the app makes this HTTP (REST) request to Finesse Web Services.
-   **Step 8**.  Finesse processes the request and then, if necessary, requests action with Unified CCE via CTI connection.  Where applicable, Unified CCE performs/forwards the requested action.
-   **Step 9**.  Unified CCE notifies Finesse via CTI connection about whether the request was successful or caused an error.
-   **Step 10**.  Finesse processes the notification (successful/error) and publishes the notification to Notification Service.  The agent web browser receives this notification from Notification Service via the BOSH connection.

&nbsp;

The Finesse agent goes through various states that specifically pertain to the agent workflow (see Table 10-9).

&nbsp;

**Table 10-9** User States in Finesse 

&nbsp;

| State | Description |
| -- | -- | 
| LOGIN | The agent is signing in to the system.  This is an intermediate state. |
| LOGOUT | The agent is signed off the system. |
| READY | The agent is ready to take calls. |
| NOT_READY | The agent is signed in but not ready to take calls.  It could be on a break, or the shift might be over, or the agent might be in between calls. |
| RESERVED | This is a transient state, as the agent gets chosen but has not answered the call. |
| TALKING | The agent is on a call. |
| HOLD | The agent puts the call on hold. |

&nbsp;

## Cisco Finesse API

&nbsp;

The Cisco Finesse API is a modern, open-standards-based web API, exposed via REST.  Each function available in the Cisco Finesse user interface has a corresponding REST API that allows all types of integration for developers to use.  The extensibility and ease of use of the API are unprecedented on Unified CCX.  Agents and supervisors use the Cisco Finesse desktop APIs to communicate between the Finesse desktop and Finesse server, and they use ***Unified Contact Center Enterprise (Unified CCE)*** or ***Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX)*** to send and receive information.

&nbsp;

The Finesse APIs can be broadly classified into the following categories:

-   User
-   Dialog
-   Queue
-   Team
-   ClientLog
-   Task Routing APIs
-   Single Sign-On
-   TeamMessage

&nbsp;

Cisco Finesse supports both HTTP and HTTP Secure (HTTPS) requests from clients.  Cisco Finesse desktop operations can be performed using one of the many available REST-like HTTP/HTTPS requests.  Operations on specific objects are performed using the ID of the object in the REST URL.  For example, the URL to view a single object (HTTP) would be as follows:

`http://<FQDN>:<port>/finesse/api/<object>/<objectID>`

where FQDN is the fully qualified domain name of the Finesse server.

&nbsp;

Finesse configuration APIs require the application user ID and password, which are established during installation, for authentication purposes.

&nbsp;

Finesse APIs use the following HTTP methods to make requests:

-   **GET**:  Retrieves a single value in an object (for example, a single user or list of users).
-   **PUT**:  Replaces a value in an object (for example, to change the state of a user from NOT_READY to READY).
-   **POST**:  Creates a new entry in a collection (for example, to create a new reason code or wrap-up reason).
-   **DELETE**:  Removes an entry from a collection (for example, to delete a reason code or wrap-up reason).

&nbsp;

Finesse uses the standard HTTP status codes (for example, 200, 400, and 500) in the response to indicate the overall success or failure of a request.

&nbsp;

## API Authentication

&nbsp;

All Finesse APIs use HTTP BASIC authentication, which requires the credentials to be sent in the authorization header.  The credentials contain the username and password, separated by a single colon (:), within a Base64-encoded string.  For example, the authorization header would contain the following string:

```
"Basic ZGV2YXNjOnN0cm9uZ3Bhc3N3b3Jk"
```

where ZGV2YXNjOnN0cm9uZ3Bhc3N3b3Jk is the Base64-encoded string *devasc:strongpassword* (where *devasc* is the username, and *strongpassword* is the password.)  Example 10-8 shows three liens of code that do Base64 encoding in order to plug the value in the authorization headers.

&nbsp;

**Example 10-8** *Python Code to Generate Base64 Encoding*

```python
""" Generate Base64 Encoding """
import base64
ENCODED = base64.b64encode('devasc:strongpassword'.encode('UTF-8'))
print(ENCODED.decode('utf-8'))
```

&nbsp;

With Single Sign-On mode, the authorization header would contain the following string:

```
"Bearer <authtoken>"
```

&nbsp;

## Finesse User APIs

&nbsp;

Table 1-10 lists the various methods and User APIs to perform operations with the user, such as listing, logging in, and changing properties.

&nbsp;

**Table 10-10** Finesse User APIs

| Method | API | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| GET | <pre>http://\<FQDN>/finesse/api/User/\<id></pre> | Get a copy of the user object |
| GET | <pre>http://\<FQDN>/finesse/api/User</pre> | Get a list of all users |
| PUT | <pre>http://\<FQDN>/finesse/api/User/\<id><br>with XML body:<br>\<User><br>  \<state>LOGIN\</state><br>\<extension>5250001\</extension><br>\</User> | Sign in to the CTI server |
| PUT | <pre>http://\<FQDN>/finesse/api/User/\<id><br>with XML body:<br>\<User><br>\<state>READY\</state><br>\</User> | Set the user's state:<br> <li>READY <li>NOT_READY <li>LOGOUT |
| GET | <pre>http://\<FQDN>/finesse/api/User/\<id>\PhoneBooks</pre> | Get a list of phone books and the first 15000 associated contacts for that user |

&nbsp;

A full list of all User state change APIs with details can be found at https://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/#!userchange-agent-state/userchange-agent-state.

&nbsp;

For example, the User-Sign in to Finesse API forces you to sign-in.  Say that you use the following information with this API:

-   **Finesse server FQDN**:  http://hq-uccx01.abc.inc
-   **Agent name**:  Anthony Phyllis
-   **Agent ID**:  user001
-   **Agent password**:  cisco1234

&nbsp;

Example 10-9 shows a simple call using Python requests.  The API call for user login uses the PUT request along with an XML body that sets the state to LOGIN.

&nbsp;

**Example 10-9** *Python Request: Finesse User Login*

```python
""" Finesse - User Login"""
import requests

URL = "http://hq-uccx.abc.inc:8082/finesse/api/User/Agent001"
PAYLOAD = (
    "<User>" +
    "    <state>LOGIN</state>" +
    "    <extension>6001</extension>" +
    "</User>"
)

HEADERS = {
    'authorization': "Basic QWdlbnQwMDE6Y2lzY29wc2R0",
    'content-type': "application/xml",
    }
RESPONSE = requests.request("PUT", URL, data=PAYLOAD, headers=HEADERS)
print(RESPONSE.text)
print(RESPONSE.status_code)
```

&nbsp;

As another example, the User State Change API lets the users change their state.  State changes could be any one as shown in Table 10-9.  Say that use the following information with this API:

-   **Finesse server FQDN**:  http://hq-uccx01.abc.inc
-   **Agent name**:  Anthony Phyllis
-   **Agent ID**:  user001
-   **Agent password**:  cisco1234

&nbsp;

Example 10-10 shows a simple call using Python requests.  The API call for user login uses the PUT request along with an XML body that sets the state to READY.

&nbsp;

**Example 10-10** *Python Request for a Finesse User State Change*

```python
""" Finesse - User State Change"""
import requests

URL = "http://hq-uccx.abc.inc:8082/finesse/api/User/Agent001"
PAYLOAD = (
    "<User>" +
    "    <state>READY</state>" +
    "</User>"
)

HEADERS = {
    'authorization': "Basic QWdlbnQwMDE6Y2lzY29wc2R0",
    'content-type': "application/xml",
    }
RESPONSE = requests.request("PUT", URL, data=PAYLOAD, headers=HEADERS)
print(RESPONSE.text)
print(RESPONSE.status_code)
```

&nbsp;

## Finesse Team APIs

&nbsp;

The Team object represents a team and contains the URI, the team name, nd the users associated with the team.  Table 10-11 shows the Finesse Team aPIs to access the Team object and list all team messages.

&nbsp;

**Table 10-11** Finesse Team APIs

| Method | API | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| GET | <pre>http://\<FQDN>/finesse/api/Team/\<id>?includeLoggedOutAgents=true</pre> | Allow a user to get a copy of the Team object |
| GET | <pre>http://\<FQDN>/finesse/api/Team/\<teamid>/TeamMessages</pre> | Get a list of all active team messages for a particular team |

&nbsp;

A full list of the Team APIs, with details, can be found at https://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/#team-apis.

&nbsp;

The Python script in Example 10-11 shows how to make an API call to get details about Team ID 2.

&nbsp;

**Example 10-11** *Python Request to Get Finesse Team Details*

```python
import requests
url = "https://hq-uccx.abc.inc:8445/finesse/api/Team/2"
headers = {
    'authorization': "Basic QWdlbnQwMDE6Y2lzY29wc2R0",
    'cache-control': "no-cache",
    }
response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

&nbsp;

Dialog APIs

&nbsp;

The Dialog object represents a dialog (voice or non-voice) between two or more users.  There are many flavors of dialog APIs.  Table 10-12 shows the Finesse dialog API, which lets two users make a call with each other.

&nbsp;

**Table 10-12** Sample of finesse Dialog APIs

| Method | API | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| POST | <pre>http://\<FQDN>/finesse/api/User/\<id>/Diaglogs<br>with XML Body:<br>\<Dialog><br>  \<requestedAction>MAKE_CALL\</requestedAction><br>  \<fromAddress>6001\</fromAddress><br>  \<toAddress>6002\</toAddress><br>\</Dialog></pre> | Allow a user to make a call |
| PUT | <pre>http://\<FQDN>/finesse/api/Dialog\<diaglogId><br>with XML body:<br>\<Dialog><br>  \<requestedAction>START_RECORDING\</requestedAction><br>  \<targetMediaAddress>6001\</targetMediaAddress><br>\</Dialog></pre> | Allow a user to start recording an active call |

&nbsp;

A full list of the Dialog APIs, with  details, can be found at https://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/#dialog.apis.

&nbsp;

The Python script in Example 10-12 shows how to make an PAI call to make a call between extension 6001 and extension 6002.

&nbsp;

**Example 10-12** *Python Request to Initiate a Dialog Between Two Numbers*

```python
""" Finesse - Initiate a dialog between two numbers """
import requests

URL = "http://hq-uccx.abc.inc:8082/finesse/api/User/Agent001/Dialogs"
PAYLOAD = (
    "<Dialog>" +
    "    <requestedAction>MAKE_CALL</requestedAction>" +
    "    <fromAddress>6001</fromAddress>" +
    "    <toAddress>6002</toAddress>" +
    "</Dialog>"
)

HEADERS = {
    'authorization': "Basic QWdlbnQwMDE6Y2lzY29wc2R0",
    'content-type': "application/xml",
    'cache-control': "no-cache",
    }
RESPONSE = requests.request("POST", URL, data=PAYLOAD, headers=HEADERS)
print(RESPONSE.text)
print(RESPONSE.status_code)
```

&nbsp;

## Finesse Gadgets

&nbsp;

As indicated earlier in this chapter, the Finesse desktop application is an OpenSocial gadget container.  This means that an agent or anyone else can customize what is on the desktop.  Gadgets are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  A gadget is a simple but powerful tool that allows an agent to quickly send one or more web pages (carefully curated by the client teams themselves) to their caller over Instant Messenger or via email.  This feature automates the four or five manual steps usually associated with this task.

&nbsp;

A gadget is defined using declarative XML syntax that is processed by a gadget server so that it can be embed into the follow contexts:

-   Standalone web pages
-   Web applications
-   Other gadgets

&nbsp;

The Finesse JavaScript library can be found on a Finesse server at `http(s)://<FQDN>:<port>/desktop/assets/js/doc/index.html`.

&nbsp;

Several gadgets are available at https://developer.cisco.com/docs/finesse/#!sample-gadgets/sample-gadgets.

&nbsp;

# Webex Meetings APIs

&nbsp;

The Webex Meetings APIs let users incorporate Cisco Webex meetings into their own applications:

-   **URL API**:  The URL API is a convenient lightweight, HTTP/HTTPS-based mechanism that provides browser-based external hooks into Webex Meetings services.  The URL API is typically used in enterprise portal integrations to support basic interactions such as ***single sign-on (SSO)***, scheduling meetings, starting and joining simple meetings, and inviting attendees and presenters.  Figure 10-10 provides a high-level overview of where the URL API integration layer resides.

&nbsp;

**Figure 10-10** *Webex Meetings API Architecture*

![Figure 10-10 Webex Meetings API Architecture](assets/images/Figure%2010-10%20Webex%20Meetings%20API%20Architecture.jpeg)

&nbsp;

-   **XML API**:  If more advanced integration is needed than is possible with the URL API, Cisco strongly recommends using the Webex Meetings XML API.  the XML API is a comprehensive set of services that supports most aspects of Webex Meetings services, including detailed user management, comprehensive scheduling features, and attendee management and reporting.  The Webex XML API uses a ***service-oriented architecture (SOA)*** to provide comprehensive services to external applications wishing to interact with one or more Webex services.
-   **Teleconference Service Provider (TSP) API**:  The TSP API provides full-featured XML-based integration with audio conferencing networks.  The integration architecture supports redundancy, failover, and load balancing, and it provides robust features that tightly integrate audio conferencing capabilities with telephony management and provisioning in the Webex environment.

&nbsp;

Table 10-13 summarizes the available URL API services and simple commands for integrating with a Webex Meetings - hosted websites.

&nbsp;

>   ***`Key Topic`***

&nbsp;

**Table 10-13** Webex Meetings Services Supported via APIs

| Service Name | Integration Usage |

&nbsp;

## Authentication

&nbsp;

There are three methods by which a user can interact with the Webex Meetings via APIs:

-   **Webex Meetings integration**:  An application can authenticate XML API requests using OAuth 2.0 access tokens.  This authentication method does require end-user authorization and authentication and is best used when performing API functions on behalf of the activate user.
-   **Administrative account**:  A system account can perform administrative functions on behalf of host users.  This method requires the username and password to be passed via XML.
-   **User accounts**:  A system account can perform functions only for its own accounts.  This method requires the username and password be to passed via XML.

&nbsp;

## Integration API Keys

&nbsp;

In order to use the Webex Meetings APIs, you need to preregister an API key and then use the HM256 algorithm to generate a JWT token to access a Webex anonymous API (e.g., **GetSessionInfoAgg**, **GetAllSitesByEmailAgg**).

&nbsp;

To apply for an API key, visit https://api.webex.com/gapi/registerapikey.  After you apply for the key, you get the API and the secret (see Example 10-13).

&nbsp;

**Example 10-13** *Webex Meeting Integration Key Obtained via the Portal*

```

## Webex XML APIs

&nbsp;

The Webex XML model utilizes the exchange of well-formed XML documents to deploy messages.  Each of these relates to a specific Webex operation.  An XML request document specifies the desired action of the particular service's elements.  The XML response document returned by the Webex XML server describes the revised state of that service, as determined by the Webex XML server.

&nbsp;

Figure 10-11 provides a simplified representation of the architecture o the Webex model.

&nbsp;

**Figure 10-11** *Webex XML Model Architecture*

![Figure 10-11 Webex XML Model Architecture](assets/images/Figure%2010-11%20Webex%20XML%20Model%20Architecture.jpeg)

&nbsp;

>   ***`Key Topic`***

&nbsp;

As shown in Figure 10-11, an application sends a request XML document to perform a specific request - such as creating a new meeting - to the Webex XML server.  This request XML document describes the state of the elements associated with the operation for this request.  The Webex XML server then returns to the original application the revised element values for this operation via a response XML document created by the Webex XML document processor.

&nbsp;

The Webex XML server can be accessed at https://api.webex.com/WBXService/XMLService.

&nbsp;

## Creating a New Meeting

&nbsp;

The CreateMeeting API enables users to schedule a meeting.  This API returns a unique meeting key for the session.  Table 10-14 shows the API and the XML body to create a new meeting.

&nbsp;

**Table 10-14** Creating or Scheduling a Webex Meeting

| Method | API | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| POST | <pre>https://api.Webex.com/WBXService/XMLService<br>with XML body:<br>\<body><br>  \<bodyContent xsi:type="java:com.Webex.service.binding.meeting.CreateMeeting"><br>    \<metaData><br>      \<confName>Branding Meeting\</confName><br>    \<metaData><br>    \<schedule><br>      \<startDate/><br>    \</schedule><br>  \</bodyContent><br>\</body> | Create a new meeting with various attributes such as name, start time, password, and attendees. |

&nbsp;

Example 10-14 shows how to make an API call to create a new meeting with a particular subject line.  The response is usually the new meeting ID.

## Listing All My Meetings Meeting

The LstsummaryMeeting API lists summary information for scheduled meetings.  This API returns a unique meeting key for a session.  Table 10-15 shows the XML data that needs to be sent in order to list all meetings sorted by start time.

&nbsp;

**Table 10-15** Listing All Webex Meetings That Match Certain Criteria

| Method | API | Description |

## Setting or Modifying Meeting Attributes

&nbsp;

The SetMeeting API enables host/users to update the information for a scheduled meeting that they are able to edit.  Table 10-16 shows the XML data that needs to be sent in order to modify meeting attributes.  

&nbsp;

**Table 10-16** Modify Meeting Attributes

| Method | API | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| POST | <pre>https://api.Webex.com/WBXService/XMLService<br>with XML body:<br>\<bodyContent xsi:type="java.com.Webex.service.binding.meeting.SetMeeting"><br>  \<meetingkey>625579604\</meetingkey><br>  \<participants><br>    \<attendees><br>      \<attendee><br>        \<person><br>          \<email>student@devasc.com\</email><br>        \</person><br>      \</attendee><br>    \</attendees><br>  \</participants><br>\</bodyContent></pre> | Update meeting attributes such as attendees, record meeting, schedules, and media support |

&nbsp;

Example 10-16 shows how to make an API call to add a new attendee (student@devasc.com) to the meeting and send an email invitation to that person.

## Deleting a Meeting

&nbsp;

The DelMeeting API allows hosts to delete a meeting that is not currently in progress.  The API continues to use the POST method, but the XML data contains the operation of deleting the meeting.  Table 10-17 shows the XML data that needs to be send in order to delete a meeting.

&nbsp;

**Table 10-17** Deleting a Webex Meeting Using the Meeting Key

| Method | API | Description |

&nbsp;

The Meetings XML API provides a method to integrate Webex Meetings services with your custom web portal or application.  For more details about the Webex Meetings APIs, see https://developer.cisco.com/docs/Webex-meetings/#!Webex-meetings.

&nbsp;

# Webex Devices

&nbsp;

Webex Devices enables users to communicate and work with each other in real time.  The collaboration devices can be placed in meeting rooms or at desks.  Except for the high-quality audio and video support, these devices are fully programmable.  Through embedded APIs (often referenced as xAPI), you can extend and leverage Webex Room and Desk device capabilities in several ways:

-   Create user interface components to customize the meeting experience and control IoT devices such as lights, curtains, and projectors from the device controls interface
-   Configure devices at scale via automation scripts
-   Initiate or respond to calls automatically
-   Deploy code onto the devices without needing to deploy external control systems

&nbsp;

Webex Devices include the following devices, as shown in Figure 10-12:

-   **Webex Board**:  
    -   Cisco Webex Room Kit
    -   Room Kit Plus
    -   Room Kit Pro
-   **Room Devices**:  
    -   Room 55
    -   Room 70
    -   Room 70 Dual Board
    -   board 55/55S
    -   Board 70/70S
    -   Board 85S
    -   Cisco TelePresence MX200 G2
    -   MX300 G2
    -   MX700
    -   MX800
    -   MX800 Dual
    -   SX10
    -   SX20
    -   SX80
-   **Webex Desk Device**:
    -   Cisco Webex DX80 and DX70 Collaboration Endpoint Software version 9

&nbsp;

**Figure 10-12** *Webex Boards, Room, and Desk Devices*

![Figure 10-12 Webex Boards, Room, and Desk Devices](assets/images/Figure%2010-12%20Webex%20Boards,%20Room,%20and%20Desk%20Devices.jpeg)

&nbsp;

## xAPI

&nbsp;

>   ***`Key Topic`***

&nbsp;

xAPI is the API for collaboration endpoint software (Cisco CE and RoomOS) for both on-premises registered video conferencing devices (Unified CM and VCS) and devices registered to Cisco's cloud service (Cisco Webex Devices).  xAPI consists of four major groups:

-   Commands
-   Configurations
-   Status
-   Events

&nbsp;

Table 10-18 shows the high-level API categories that xAPI supports.

&nbsp;

**Table 10-18** xAPI Categories

| Method | API | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| GET | http://\<ip-address>/status.xml | Get the complete status of the device |
| GET | http://\<ip-address>/configurations.xml | Get the complete configuration of the device |
| GET | http://\<ip-address>/command.xml | Get the complete command set supported by the device |
| GET | http://\<ip-address>/valuespace.xml | Get an overview of all the value spaces used in the system settings, status information, and commands |
| POST | http://\<ip-address>/putxml | Configure any settings on the device |

&nbsp; 

## xAPI Authentication

&nbsp; 

Access to xAPI requires the user to authenticate using HTTP basic access authentication as a user with the ADMIN role.  Unauthenticated requests prompt a 401 HTTP response containing a basic access authentication challenge.

&nbsp; 

If an application will be issuing multiple commands through xAPI, it is recommended that you use session authentication because the standard basic authentication does a full re-authentication per request, which may affect the performance of your application.

&nbsp; 

## xAPI Session Authentication

&nbsp; 

Authenticating with your username and password combination for each API request might introduce too much latency for some use cases.  To mitigate this, the API supports a session-based authentication mechanism.

&nbsp; 

To open a session, issue a POST to http://\<ip-address>/xmlapi/session/begin with basic access authentication.  The response sets a SessionId-cookie that can be used with subsequent requests.

&nbsp; 

Note that when using API session authentication, it is important to explicitly close the session when you are done.  Failing to do so may cause the device to run out of sessions, as a limited number of concurrent sessions are available, and they do not time out automatically.

&nbsp; 

## Creating a Session

&nbsp; 

You create a session by sending an xAPI session request to the endpoint.  Example 10-18 shows a simple Python POST request, to which the server responds with the session cookie.

&nbsp; 

**Example 10-18** *Python Script to Get a Session Cookie*

```python
""" Webex Device - Endpoint Status """

import requests
URL = "http://10.10.20.159/status.xml"
HEADERS = {
    'Cookie': "SessionId=c6ca2fc23d3f211e0517d4c603fbe4205c77d13dd6913c7bc12eef4085b
7637b"
}

RESPONSE = requests.request("GET", URL, headers=HEADERS)
print(RESPONSE.text)
```

&nbsp; 

Setting Device attributes

&nbsp; 

When a session is established, the session cookie is used in each of the interactions.  Example 10-21 shows how to use the cookie to set the camera position with certain pan and tilt values.

&nbsp; 

**Example 01-21** *Python Script to Send a Command to Set the Camera*

```python
""" Webex Device - Set Camera Position """

import requests

URL = "http://10.10.20.159/put.xml"

PAYLOAD = (
    '<Command>' +
    '  <Camera>' +
    '    <PositionSet command="True">' +
    '    <CameraId>1</CameraId>' +
    '    <Pan>150</Pan>' +
    '    <Tilt>150</Tilt>' +
    '    </PositionSet>' +
    '  </Camera>' +
    '</Command>'
)

HEADERS = {
    'Content-Type': "application/xml",
    'Cookie': "SessionId=c6ca2fc23d3f211e0517d4c603fbe4205c77d13dd6913c7bc12eef4085b
7637b"
}

RESPONSE = requests.request("POST", URL, data=PAYLOAD, headers=HEADERS)
print(RESPONSE.text)
```

&nbsp; 

## Registering an Event Notification Webhook

&nbsp; 

You can get a device or an endpoint to post HTTP event notifications (via webhook) on changes to the API state (for example, statuses, events, configuration, updates).  These events are sent to the specified server URL.  You can choose between events being posted in either XML or JSON format.  You can subscribe to changes on multiple parts of the API by registering up to 15 different feedback expressions.  The command for registering is **xCommand HttpFeedback**.

&nbsp; 

The HttpFeedback Register syntax is as follows:

```
FeedbackSlot: <1..4> ServerUrl(r): <S: 1, 2048> Format: <XML/JSON>
Expression: <S: 1, 255> Expression: <S: 1, 255> Expression: <S: 1, 255>
Expression: <S: 1, 255> Expression: <S: 1, 255> Expression: <S: 1, 255>
Expression: <S: 1, 255> Expression: <S: 1, 255> Expression: <S: 1, 255>
Expression: <S: 1, 255> Expression: <S: 1, 255> Expression: <S: 1, 255>
Expression: <S: 1, 255> Expression: <S: 1, 255> Expression: <S: 1, 255>
```

&nbsp;

Example 10-22 shows a simple Python POst to register a webhook.

&nbsp;

**Example 10-22** *Python Script to Set a Webhook to Receive Event Notifications*

```python
""" Webex Devices - Set Webhook """

import requests 

URL = "http://10.10.20.159/put.xml"

PAYLOAD = (
    '<Command>' +
    '  <HttpFeedback>' +
    '    <Register command="True">' +
    '      <FeedbackSlot>1</FeedbackSlot>' +
    '      <ServerUrl>http://127.0.0.1/devasc-webhook</ServerUrl>' +
    '      <Format>JSON</Format>' +
    '      <Expression item="1">/Configuration</Expression>' +
    '      <Expression item="2">/Event/CallDisconnect</Expression>' +
    '      <Expression item="3">/Status/Call</Expression>' +
    '    </Register>' +
    '  </HttpFeedback>' +
    '</Command>'
)

HEADERS = {
    'Content-Type': "application/xml",
    'Cookie': "SessionId=c6ca2fc23d3f211e0517d4c603fbe4205c77d13dd6913c7bc12eef4
    085b7637b,SessionId=c6ca2fc23d3f211e0517d4c603fbe4205c77d13dd6913c7bc12eef40
    85b7637b; SessionId=c6ca2fc23d3f211e0517d4c603fbe4205c77d13dd6913c7bc12eef4085b7
    637b"
}

RESPONSE = requests.request("POST", URL, data=PAYLOAD, headers=HEADERS)
print(RESPONSE.text)
```

&nbsp;

## Room Analytics People Presence Detector

&nbsp;

People Presence shows day-to-day conference room usage analytics and helps you find available meeting rooms based on facial recognition and ultrasonic technology.  xAPI allows you to turn on/off the detector via an API.  Example 10-23 shows a Python script that sets the People Presence detector on a device to ON.

&nbsp;

**Example 10-23** *Python Script to Set the People Presence Detector to ON*

```python
""" Webex Devices - Set People Presence detector ON """

import requests

URL = "http://10.10.20.159/put.xml"

PAYLOAD = (
    '<Configuration>' +
    '  <RoomAnalytics>'
    '    <PeoplePresenceDetector>On</PeoplePresenceDetector>' +
    '  </RoomAnalytics>' +
    '</Configuration>'
)

HEADERS = {
    'Content-Type': "application/xml",
    'Cookie': "SessionId=c6ca2fc23d3f211e0517d4c603fbe4205c77d13dd6913c7bc12eef4085b
7637b"
    }

RESPONSE = requests.request("POST", URL, data=PAYLOAD, headers=HEADERS)

print(RESPONSE.text)
```

# Cisco Unified Communications Manager

&nbsp;

Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) is the powerful call-processing component of the Cisco Unified Communications solution.  Unified CM supports the follow interface types:

-   Provisioning interfaces
-   Device monitoring and call control interfaces
-   Serviceability interfaces
-   Routing rules interfaces

&nbsp;

## Administrative XML

&nbsp;

>   ***`Key Topic`***

&nbsp;

The Administrative XML (AXL) API provides a mechanism for inserting, retrieving, updating, and removing data from the Unified CM configuration database using an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) interface.  It allows a programmer to access Unified CM provisioning services using XML and exchange data in XML form.  The AXL methods, referred to as *requests*, are performed using a combination of HTTP and SOAP.  SOAP is an XML remote procedure call protocol.  Users perform requests by sending XML data to the Unified CM publisher server, which then returns the AXL response, which is also a SOAP message.  For more information, see https://developer.cisco.com/docs/axl/#!axl-developer-guide/overview.

&nbsp;

Example of Unified CM objects that can be provisioned with AXL include the following:

-   Unified CM groups
-   Call park DNs
-   Call pickup groups
-   Calling search spaces
-   CTI route points
-   Device pools
-   Device profiles
-   Dial plan tags
-   Dial plans
-   Digit discard instructions
-   Directory numbers
-   Gateways (analog, T1, PRI)
-   Locations
-   MGCP devices
-   Phones
-   Process nodes
-   Process node services
-   Regions
-   Route filters
-   Route groups
-   Route lists
-   Route partitions
-   Service parameters
-   Translation patterns
-   Users
-   Voicemail ports

&nbsp;

## Cisco AXL Toolkit

&nbsp;

You can download the AXL Toolkit from Unified CM Administration page (https://\<CUCM-Address>/plugins/axlsqltoolkit.zip), as shown in Figure 10-13.  

&nbsp;

**Figure 10-13** *AXL Toolkit Zip File*

![Figure 10-13 AXL Toolkit Zip File](assets/images/Figure%2010-13%20AXL%20Toolkit%20Zip%20File.jpeg)

&nbsp;

When you download the AXL Toolkit and unzip the file, the schema folder contains AXL API schema files for supported AXL versions:

-   **AXLAPI.wsdl**:  WSDL file
-   **AXLEnums.xsd**:  Enum type definitions
-   **AXLSoap.xsd**:  Type definitions

&nbsp;

The se XML schema files contain full details about the AXL API format, including the request names, fields/elements, data types used, and field validation rules.  One advantage of .xsd schema files is that they can be used to automatically/programmatically validate a particular XML document against the schema to ensure that it is well formatted and valid according to the schema specs.

&nbsp;

Many XML editing applications and programmatic tools and components that use .xsd schema files to validate XML documents and details about how to do so may vary.  The main necessary detail, however, is to define the **xsi:schemaLocation** attribute with a URI pointing to the axlsoap.xsd schema file.

&nbsp;

## Accessing the AXL SOAP API

&nbsp;

Now let's take a look at two different methods to access the AXL SOAP API.

&nbsp;

## Using the Zeep Client Library

&nbsp;

The Python script in Example 10-24 shows how to make an API call to update a phone device and get complete information about the phone.  It uses the AXLAPI.wsdl file downloaded with the AXL Toolkit.

&nbsp;

**Example 10-24** *Full Client Code to Update and Get Back Device Details*

```python
""" Update and Retrieve Client Details """

from zeep import Client
from zeep.cache import SqliteCache
from zeep.transports import Transport
from requests import Session
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
import urllib3
from urllib3.exceptions import InsecureRequestWarning

urllib3.disable_warnings(InsecureRequestWarning)

USERNAME = 'administrator'
PASSWORD = 'ciscopsdt'
IP_ADDRESS = "10.10.20.1"
WSDL = 'schema//12.0//AXLAPI.wsdl'
BINDING_NAME = "{http://www.cisco.com/AXLAPIService/}AXLAPIBinding"
ADDRESS = "https://{ip}:8443/axl/".format(ip=IP_ADDRESS)
def update_phone_by_name(client, name, description):
    """ Update Phone by Name """
    return client.updatePhone(**{'name': name, 'description': description})

def get_phone_by_name(client, name):
    """ Get Phone by Name """
    return client.getPhone(name=name)

def main():
    """ Main """
    session = Session()
    session.verify = False
    session.auth = HTTPBasicAuth(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
    transport = Transport(cache=SqliteCache(), session=session, timeout=60)
    client = Client(wsdl=WSDL, transport=transport)
    axl = client.create_service(BINDING_NAME, ADDRESS)

    update_phone_by_name(axl, "SEP001122334455", "DevAsc: adding new Desc")
    print(get_phone_by_name(axl, "SEP001122334455"))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

&nbsp;

## Using the CiscoAXL SDK

&nbsp;

The Python SDK called CiscoAXL is pretty simple to use.  As of this writing, there are other SDKs available, but we use CiscoAXL here as an example.  to start with this SDK, you need to install it by using the **pip** or **pip3** command:

`pip install ciscoaxl or pip install ciscoaxl`

&nbsp;

Example 10-25 shows the simplest way to invoke the SDK and start working with it.

&nbsp;

**Example 10-25** *Using the CiscoAXL SDK to Get Phone Information*

```python
""" Using CiscoAXL SDK to get phone info"""

from ciscoaxl import axl

CUCM = '10.10.20.1'
CUCM_USER = "administrator"
CUCM_PASSWORD = "ciscopsdt"
CUCM_VERSION = '12.0'
ucm = axl(username=CUCM_USER,password=CUCM_PASSWORD,cucm=CUCM,cucm_version=CUCM_
VERSION)
print (ucm)
for phone in ucm.get_phones():
    print(phone.name)
for user in ucm.get_users():
    print(user.firstName)
```

&nbsp;
