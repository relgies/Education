## **Software Development Lifecycle**

&nbsp;

In the world of software, the ***Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)*** provides sanity by providing guidance on building sustainable software packages.  SDLC lays out a plan for building, fixing, replacing, and making alterations to software.

&nbsp;

These are the stages of the SDLC:
 
 &nbsp;

 -  **Stage 1 - Planning**:  Identify the current use case or problem the software is intended to solve.  Get input from stakeholders, end users, and experts to determine what success looks like.  This is also known as *requirements analysis*.
-   **Stage 2 - Defining**:  This stage involves analyzing the functional specifications of the software - basically defining what the software is supposed to do.
-   **Stage 3 - Designing**:  In this phase, you turn the software specifications into a design specification.  This is a critical stage as stakeholders need to be in agreement in order to build the software appropriately; if they arne't, users won't be happy, and the project will not be successful.
-   **Stage 4 - Building**:  Once the software design specification is complete, the programmers get to work on making it a reality.  If the previous stages are completed successfully, this stage is often considered the easy part.
-   **Stage 5 - Testing**:  Does the software work as expected?  In this stage, the programmers check for bugs and defects.  The software is continually examined and tested until it successfully meets the original software specifications.
-   **Stage 6 - Deployment**t:  During this stage, the software is put into production for the end users to put it through its paces.  Deployment is often initially done in a limited way to do any final tweaking or detect any missed bugs.  Once the user has accepted the software and it is in full production, this stage morphs into maintenance, where bug fixes and software tweaks or smaller changes are made at the request of the business user.

&nbsp;

There are quite a few SDLC models that further refine the generic process just described.  They all use the same core concepts but vary in terms of implementation and utility for different projects and teams.  The following are some of the most popular SDLC models:

-   Waterfall
-   Lean
-   Agile
-   Interactive model
-   Spiral model
-   V model
-   Big Bang model
-   Prototyping models

You don't need to know all of these for the 200-901 DevNet ASsociate DEVASC exam.  The following sections cover the ones you should know most about:  Waterfall, Lean, and Agile.

&nbsp;

### **Waterfall**

&nbsp;

Origin:  The construction industry followed a rigid process in which every step along the way was dependent on the completion of the previous step in the process.  If you wanted to end up with a building that stays standing and meets the original design, you can't start construction until you have a plan and analyze the requirements for the building.  This thought process mapped nicely to software development, and the complexity of designing and constructing a building was similar to that of creating software applications.  ***Waterfall, which is based on the construction industry approach, became one of the most popular SDLC approaches.***

Waterfall is a serial approach to software development that is divided into phases:

-   **Requirements / analysis**:  Software features and functionality needs are cataloged and assessed to determine the necessary capabilities of the software.
-   **Design**:  The software architecture is defined and documented.
-   **Coding**:  Software coding begins, based on the previously determined design.
-   **Testing**:  The completed code is tested for quality and customer acceptance.
-   **Maintenance**:  Bug fixes and patches are applied.

While this approach has worked successfully over the years, a number of shortcomings have become weaknesses in this approach.

-   First, the serial nature of Waterfall, while easy to understand, means that the scope of a software project is fixed at the design phase.  In construction, making changes to the first floor of a building after you have begun the fifth floor is extremely difficult - and may even be impossible unless you knock down the building and start from scratch.  In essence, the Waterfall approach does not handle change well at all.  When you finally get to the coding phase of the application development process, you might learn that the feature you are building isn't needed anymore or discover a new way of accomplishing a design goal; however, you cannot deviate from the predetermined architecture without redoing the analysis and design.  Unfortunately, it is often more painful to start over than to keep building.  It is similar to being stuck building a bridge over a river that no one needs anymore.
-   The second aspect of Waterfall that is challenging is that value is not achieved until the end of the whole process.  We write software to automate some business functions or capability - and value is only realized when the software is in production and producing results.  With the Waterfall approach, even if you are halfway done with a project, you still have no usable code or value to show to the business.  Halfway Finished?  50% Complete, 100% Unusable.
-   The third aspect of Waterfall that is challenging is quality.  As mentioned earlier, time is the enemy when it comes to delivering value.  If we had unlimited time, we could create perfect software every time, but we simply don't live in that world.  When software developers run out of time, testing often suffers or is sacrificed in the name of getting the project out the door.

In short:
1.  Fixed design means changes cannot be made after the analysis and design phase.
2.  Value is not achieved until 100% of the project is complete.
3.  Quality suffers in order to complete the project in time.

The three challenges for Waterfall led to the development of a new way of creating software that was faster, better, and more adaptive to a rapidly changing environment.

&nbsp;

### **Lean**

&nbsp;

Origin:  After World War II, Japan was in desperate need of rebuilding.  Most of Japan's production capabilities had been destroyed, including those in the auto industry.  When Japan tackled this rebuilding, it didn't concentrate on only the buildings and infrastructure; it looked at ways to do things differently.  Out of this effort, the **Toyota Production System (TPS)** was born.  *Created by Taiichi Ohno and Sakichi Toyoda (founder of Toyota), this management and manufacturing process focuses on the following important concepts*:

-   **Elimination of waste**:  If something doesn't add value to the final product, get rid of it.  There is no room for wasted work.
-   **Just-in-time**:  Don't build something until the customer is ready to buy it.  Excess inventory wastes resources.
-   **Continuous improvement (Kizan)**:  Always improve your process with lessons learned and communication.


TPS was the first implementation of these principles as a management philosophy.  TPS was the start of the more generalized Lean manufacturing approach that was introduced to the Western world in 1991 through a book written by Womack, Jones, and Roos, *The Machine That Changed the World*.  This book was based on a five-year study MIT conducted on TPS, and it has been credited with bringing Lean concepts and processes beyond the auto industry.

Why spend time talking about old management books?  Lean led to Agile software development, which has served as a lightning rod of change for IT operations.

&nbsp;

### **Agile**

&nbsp;

***Agile is an application of Lean principles to software development.***

With Agile, all of the lessons learned in optimizing manufacturing processes have been applied to the discipline of creating software.

Origin:  In 2001, 17 software developers converged on the Snowbird resort in Utah to discuss new lightweight development methods.  Tired of the missing deadlines, endless documentation, and the inflexibility of existing software development practices, these Agile pioneers created the "Manifesto for Agile Software Development," which codifies the guiding principles for Agile development practices.  The following 12 principles are the core of the Agile Manifesto:
-   Customer satisfaction is provided through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
-   Changing requirements, even in late development, are welcome.
-   Working software is delivered frequently (in weeks rather than months).
-   The process depends on close, daily cooperation between business stakeholders and developers.
-   Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted.
-   Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location).
-   Working software is the principal measure of progress.
-   Sustainable development requires being able to maintain a constant pace.
-   Continuous attention is paid to technical excellence and good design.
-   Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work done - is essential.
-   The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
-   A team regularly reflects on how to become more effective and adjusts according.

These core tenets were the main spark of the Agile movement.  Mary Poppendieck and Tom Poppendieck wrote *Lean Development:  An Agile Toolkit* in 2003, based on the principles of the Agile Manifesto and their many years of experience developing software.

With Waterfall, a project is not "finished" and deployable until the very end.  With Agile, the time frame is changed:  Agile uses smaller time increments (often 2 weeks), or "sprints," that encompass the full process of analysis, design, code, and test but on a much smaller aspect of an application.  The goal is to finish a feature or capability for each sprint, resulting in a potentially shippable incremental piece of software.  Therefore, with Agile, if you are 40% finished with a project, you have 100% usable code.

By leveraging Agile, you can keep adding value immediately and nimbly adapt to change.  If a new capability is needed in the software, or if a feature that was planned is determined to no longer be necessary, the project can pivot quickly and make those adjustments.

&nbsp;

## **Common Design Patterns**

&nbsp;

When creating software, you will often run into the same problem over and over again.  You don't want to reinvent the wheel each time you need a rolling thing to make something move.  In software engineering, many common design paradigms have already been created, and you can reuse them in your software project.  These design patterns make you faster and provide tried-and-true solutions that have been tested and refined.  The follow section introduces a couple of design patterns that are really useful for networking automation projects:  the ***Model-View-Controller (MVC)*** and ***Observer patterns***.  While there are many more that you may be interested in learning about, these are the ones you will most likely see on the 200-901 DevNet Associate DEVASC exam.

&nbsp;

### **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern**

&nbsp;

***The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern was one of the first design patterns to leverage the separation of concerns (SoC) principle***.  The SoC principle is used to decouple an application's interdependencies and functions from its other parts.  The goal is to make the various layers of the application - such as data access, business logic, and presentation (to the end user) - modular.  This modularity makes the application easier to construct and maintain while also allowing the flexibility to make changes or additions to the business logic.  It also provides a natural organization structure for a program that anyone can follow for collaborative development.  If you have used a web-based application, more than likely the app was constructed using an MVC pattern.

&nbsp;

>  **Note**
> Numerous web frameworks use MVC concepts across many programming languages.  Angular, Express, and Backbone are all written in JAvaScript.  Django and Flask are two very popular examples written in Python.

&nbsp;

The classic MVC pattern has three main parts:
-   **Model**:  The model is responsible for retrieving and manipulating data.  It is often tied to some type of database but could be data from a simple file.  It conducts all data operations, such as select, insert, update, and delete operations.  The model receives instructions from the controller.
-   **View**:  The view is what the end users see on the device they are using to interact with the program.  It could be a web page or text from the command line.  The power of the view is that it can be tailored to any device and any representation without changing any of the business logic of the model.  The view communicates with the controller by sending data or receiving output from the model through the controller.  The view's primary function is to render data.
-   **Controller**:  The controller is the intermediary between what the user sees and the backend logic that manipulates the data.  The role of the controller is to receive requests from the user via the view and pass those requests on to the model and its underlying data store.

&nbsp;

### **Observer Pattern**

&nbsp;

**The Observer pattern was created to address the problem of sharing information between one object to many other objects.**

This type of pattern describes a very useful behavior for distributed systems that need to share configuration information or details on changes as they happen.  The Observer pattern is actually very simple and consists of only two logical components:

-   **Subject**:  The subject refers to the object state being observed - in other words, the data that is to be synchronized.  The subject has a registration process that allows other components of an application or even remote systems to subscribe to the process.  Once registered, a subscriber is sent an update notification whenever there is a change in the subject's data so that the remote systems can synchronize.  
-   **Observer**:  The observer is the component that registers with the subject to allow the subject to be aware of the observer and how to communicate to it.  The only function of the observer is to synchronize its data with the subject when called.  The key thing to understand about the observer is that it does not use a polling process, which can be very inefficient with a larger number of observers registered to a subject.  Updates are push only.

*In short:  A single Subject can have multiple Observers.  When an Event Happens on the Subject, it will push a notify() to the Observers.*

***The Observer pattern is often used to handle communications between the model and the view in the MVC pattern.***  Say, for example, that you have two different views available to an end user.  One view provides a bar graph, and the other provides a scatter plot.  Both use the same data source from the model.  When the data changes or is updated, the two views need to be updated.  This is a perfect job for the Observer pattern.

&nbsp;

## **Linux BASH**

&nbsp;

For the DEVASC exam, you need to know how to use BASH and be familiar with some of the key commands.

&nbsp;

###  **Getting to Know BASH**

&nbsp;

***BASH is a shell, and a shell is simply a layer between a user and the internal workings of an operating system.***  A user can use the shell to input commands that the operating system will interpret and perform.

While there are many shells you can use, ***BASH, which stands for Bourne Again Shell***, is one of the most popular.  It has been around since 1989 and is the default shell on most Linux operating systems.  Until recently, it was also the default for the Mac operating system, but Apple has replaced BASH with Z shell.  The commands and syntax you will learn with BASH are transferable to Z shell, as it was built to maintain compatibility with BASH.

BASH is not only a shell for command processing using standard Linux operating system commands.  It can also read and interpret scripts for automation.  These capabilities are beyond the scope of what you need to know for the DEVASC exam, however are worth looking into as these automation scripts are where BASH really shines.  Like all other UNIX shells, BASH supports features such as ***piping*** (which involves feeding output from one command as the input of another command), ***variables***, ***evaluation of conditions***, and ***iteration*** (repeated processing of a command with **if** statements).  You also have a ***command history*** as part of the shell, where you can use the arrow keys to cycle through and edit previous commands.

&nbsp;

UNIX platforms such as Linux and OSX have built-in documentation for each command the operating system uses.  To access help for any command, type **man** (short for manual) and then the command you are curious about.  The output gives you a synopsis of the command, any optional flags, and required attributes.

&nbsp;

Not every command is intended to be run with user-level privileges.  You can temporarily upgrade your privileges by prepending the **sudo** command before you execute a command that needs higher-level access.  You will often be prompted for a password to verify that you have the right to use **sudo**.  You need to be careful when using **sudo**, as the whole idea of reduced privileges is to increase security and prevent average users from running commands that are dangerous.  Use **sudo** only when required, such as when you need to kick off an update for your Linux distribution, which you can do by using the **apt-get update** command:

&nbsp;

```
$sudo apt-get update
```

&nbsp;

As mentioned earlier, one of the most powerful features of BASH is something called piping.  This feature allows you to string together commands.  For example, the **cat** command displays the contents of a file to the screen.  What if a file contains too much to fit on a single screen?  The **cat** command will happily spew every character of the file at the screen until it reaches the end, regardless of whether you could keep up with it.  To address this, you can pipe the output of **cat** to the **more** command to stream the content from **cat** to **more**, which gives you a prompt to continue one page at a time.  To use the piping functionality, use the pipe character (|) between the commands.

&nbsp;

```
$cat weather.py | more
```

&nbsp;

###  **Directory Navigation**

&nbsp;

A UNIX-based file system has a directory tree structure.  The top of the tree is called the *root* (as it's an upside down tree), and you use the forward slash (/) to refer to root.  From root you have numerous directories and under each directory you have more directories or files.

Whenever you call a file, you have to supply its path.  Everything you execute in UNIX is in relationship to root.  To execute a file in the directory you are in, you can use the **./filename.sh**, where the leading **.** is simply an alias for the current directory.

In addition to the root file system, each user has a home directory that the user controls and that stores the user's individual files and applications.  The full path to the home directory often looks something like /home/*username* on Linux and /Users/*username* on Mac OS X, but you can also use the tilde shortcut (~/) to reference the home directory.

The following sections describe some of the commands most commonly used to interact with the BASH shell and provide examples of their options and use.

&nbsp;

**cd**

The **cd** command is used to change directories and move around the file system.  You can use it as follows:

| Command | Use |
| -- | -- |
| **$ cd /** | Changes directory to the root directory|
| **$ cd /home/username** | Changes directory to the /home/username directory|
| **$ cd test** | Changes directory to the test folder|
| **$ cd ..** | Moves up one directory |

&nbsp;

**pwd**

If you ever get lost while navigating around the file system, you can use the **pwd** command to print out your current working directory path.  You can use it as follows:

| Command | Use |
| -- | -- |
| **$ pwd** | Print your current working directory |

&nbsp;

**ls**

The **ls** command gives you a list of the current directory.  If you execute it without any parameters, it just displays whatever is in the directory.  It doesn't show any hidden files (such as configuration files).  Anything that starts with a **.** does not show up in a standard directory listing, and you need to use the **-a** flag to see all files, including hidden files.  By using the **-l** flag, you can see permissions and the user and group that own the file or directory.  You can also use the wildcard * to list specific filename values, for example, to find any files with test as a part of the name, you can use **ls \*test\***, which would match both 1test and test1.  You can use the ls command as follows:

| Command | Use |
| -- | -- |
| **$ ls** | Lists files and directories in the current working directory |
| **$ ls -a** | Lists everything in the current directory, including hidden files |
| **$ ls /home/username** | Lists everything in the /home/username directory | 
| **$ ls -l** | Lists permissions and user and group ownership |
| **$ ls -F** | Displays files and directories and denotes which are which |

&nbsp;

**mkdir**

To create a directory, you use the **mkdir** command.  If you are in your home directory or in another directory where you have appropriate permissions, you can use this command without **sudo**.  You can use the **mkdir** command as follows:

| Command | Use |
| -- | -- |
| **$ mkdir test** | Makes a new directory called test in the current working directory if you have permission |
| **$ mkdir /home/username/test** | Makes a new directory called test at /home/username/test |

&nbsp;

### **File Management**

&nbsp;

Working with files is easy with BASH.  There are just a few commands that you will use often, and they are described in the following sections.

&nbsp;

**cp**

The purpose of the **cp** command is to copy a file or folder someplace.  It does not delete the source file but instead makes an identical duplicate.  When editing configuration files or making changes that you may want to roll back, you can use the **cp** command to create a copy as a sort of backup.  The command requires several parameters:  the name of the file you want to copy and where you want to copy it to and the name of the copy.  When copying the contents of a folder, you need to use the **-r**, or recursive, flag.  You can use the **cp** command as follows:

| Command | Use |
| -- | -- |
| **$ cp sydney.text sydney2.txt** | Copies a file called sydney.txt from teh current directory and names the copy sydney2.txt |
| **$ cp /home/username/sydney.txt ~/sydney2.txt** | Copies a file as described above but using the full path and the home directory path |
| **$ cp -r folder folder.old** | Copies a folder |

&nbsp;

**mv**

The **mv** command allows you to move a file or folder from one directory to another, and it is also used to rename files or folders from teh command line, as BASH does not have a dedicated renaming function.  The **mv** command takes a source and destination, just as **cp** does.  You can use the **-i** flag to create an interactive option prompt when moving files that exist at the destination.  The **-f** flag forces the move and overwrites any files at the destination.  Wildcards also work to select multiple source files or directories.  You can use the **mv** command as follows:

| Command | Use |
| -- | -- |
| **$ mv caleb.txt calebfinal.txt** | Renames a file called caleb.txt to calebfinal.txt |
| **$ mv /home/username/caleb.txt ~calebfinal.txt** | Renames a file as described above but using full paths |
| **$ mv -i \* /home/username/new/** | Moves all files and directories in the current folder to a directory called new | 

&nbsp;

**rm**

To delete a file or directory, you use the **rm** command.  If the item you are deleting is a file or any empty directory, you just need to supply the name and press Enter.  On the other hand, if you try to delete a directory that has files in it, **rm** tells you that the directory is not empty.  In that case you can use the **-rf** flag to force the deletion.  You can use the **rm** command as follows:

| Command | Use | 
| -- | -- |
| **$ rm test.txt** | Deletes the file test.txt in the current working directory |
| **$ rm -rf test** | Forces the deletion of the folder test and everything in it |

&nbsp;

**touch**

The **touch** command is used to create a file and/or change the timestamps on a file's access without opening it.  This command is often used when a developer wants to create a file but doesn't want to put any content in it.  You can use the **touch** command as follows:

| Command | Use | 
| -- | -- |
| **$ touch emptyfile.txt** | Creates an empty file named emptyfile.txt |
| **$ touch file{1..20}.txt** | Bulk creates files from file1.txt to file20.txt |

&nbsp;

**cat**

The **cat** (which stands for *concatenate*) command allows you to view or create files and also pipe to other commands.  It's one of the most useful commands in UNIX when it comes to working with files.  You can use the **cat** command as follows:

| Command | Use |
| -- | -- |
| **$ cat file1.txt** | Displays the contents of file1.txt |
| **$ cat file1.txt \| more** | Displays the contents of file1.txt and pipes the output to **more** to add page breaks |
| **$ cat >file2.txt** | Sends a user's typed or copied content from the command line to ifile2.txt |

&nbsp;

### **Environment Variables** 

&nbsp;

BASH environment variables contain information about the current session.  Environment variables are available in all operating systems and are typically set when you open your terminal from a configuration file associated with your login.  You set these variables with similar syntax to how you set them when programming.  You do not often use these variables directly, but the programs and applications you launch do.  You can view all of your currently set environment variables by entering the **env** command.  Since there can be more entries than you have room to display on a single terminal page, you can pipe the results to the **more** command to pause between pages:

| Command | Use |
| -- | -- |
| **$ env \| more** | Shows all environment variables with page breaks |

If you execute this command, you are likely to notice a lot of keywords with the = sign tied to values.  One environment variable that you use every time you execute a command is the PATH variable.  This is where your shell looks for executable files.  If you add a new command and can't execute it, more than likely the place where the command was copied is not listed in your PATH.  To view any variable value, you can use the **echo** command and the variable you want to view.  You also need to tell bASH that it's a variable by using the **$** in front of it.  Here's an example:

&nbsp;

```
echo $PATH

/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Applications/VMware
Fusion.app/Contents/Public:/opt/X11/bin
```

&nbsp;

To add a new value to the PATH variable, you can't just type **$PATH=/new_directory** because the operating system reads the environment variables only when the terminal session starts.  To inform Linux that an environment variable needs to be updated, you use the **export** command.  This command allows you to append your additional path to BASH and exists for the duration of the session.  Make sure you add the **:** or **,** in front of your new value, depending on your operating system.  The following example is for a Linux-style OS:

&nbsp;

```
$ export PATH=$PATH:/Home/chrijack/bin
```

&nbsp;

When you end your terminal session, the changes you made are not saved.  To retain the changes, you need to write the path statement to your **.bashrc** (or **.zshrc** if using Z shell) profile settings.  Anything written here will be available anytime you launch a terminal.  You can simply copy, add the previous command to the end of the **.bashrc** with your favorite text editor, or use the following command:

&nbsp;

```
$ echo "export PATH=$PATH:/Home/chrijack/bin" >> .bashrc
```

&nbsp;

This addition becomes active only after you close your current session or force it to reload the variable.  The **source** command can be used to reload the variables from the hidden configuration file **.bashrc**:

&nbsp;

```
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

&nbsp;

THe following command does the same thing as the previous one because **.** is also an alias for the **source** command:

&nbsp;

```
$ . ~/.bashrc
```

&nbsp;

## **Software Version Control**

&nbsp;

**The term ***version control*** is used to describe the process of saving various copies of a file or set of files in order to track changes made to those files.**  This description highlights how incredibly useful it is to the world of programming.  ***Software version control (SVC)*** typically involves a database that stores current and historical versions of source code to allow multiple people or teams to work on it at the same time.  If a mistake is made and you want to go back a revision (or to any previous version), SVC is the answer.  You may also hear it called revision control or source control, but it all falls under the topic of software configuration management.

Version control can protect your code by allowing changes to be checked in (through a process known as ***code commit***) to a hierarchical tree structure of folders with files in them.  Each check-in is tagged with who made the change and what the person changed within the code.  Instead of using inefficient techniques such as file locking, a version control system handles concurrent check-ins, allowing two programmers to commit code at the same time.

Another aspect of a version control system is the ability to branch and merge code built independently.  This is very useful if you are writing code on a part of an application that could conflict with another part written by another team.  By creating a branch, you effectively create a separate work stream that has its own history and does not impact the main "trunk" of the code base.  Once the code is written and any conflicts are resolved, the code from the branch can be merged back into the main trunk. 

Git is one of the most commonly used version control systems today, and the 200-901 DevNet Associate DEVASC exam will test your knowledge of it, so the next section covers how to use Git.

&nbsp;

## **Git**

&nbsp;

Git is free and open source.  In 2005, Linus Torvalds (the father of Linux) created Git as an alternative to the SCM system BitKeeper, when the original owner of BitKeeper decided to stop allowing free use of the system for Linux kernel development.  Git was created to be fast and scalable, with a distributed workflow that could support the huge number of contributors to the Linux kernel.  His creation was turned over to Junio Hamano in 2006, and it has become the most widely used source management system in the world.

&nbsp; 

> **Note**
> GitHub is not Git.  GitHub is a cloud-based social networking platform for programmers that allows anyone to share and contribute to software projects (open source or private).  While GitHub uses Git as its version control system underneath the graphical front end, it is not directly tied to the Git open-source project (much as a Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu or Fedora, uses the Linux kernel but is independently developed from it).

&nbsp;

### **Understanding Git**

&nbsp;

Git is a distributed version control system built with scalability in mind.  It uses a multi-tree structure, and if you look closely at the design, you see that it looks a lot like a file system.  (Linus Torvalds is an operating system creator after all.)  Git keeps track of three main structures or trees:
-   **Local workspace**:  This is where you store source code, files, binaries, images, documentation, and whatever else you need.
-   **Staging area**:  This is an intermediary storage area for items to be synchronized (changes and new items).
-   **Head, or local repository**:  This is where you store all committed items.

*Personal Comment:  Working Directory => Staging Area (Index) => Local Repository*

Another very important concept with Git is the file lifecycle.  Each file that you add to your working directory has a status attributed to it.  This status determines how Git handles the file.  Git file status lifecycle includes the following statuses:

-   **Untracked**:  When you first create a file in a directory that Git is managing, it is given an untracked status.  Git sees this file but does not perform any type of version control operation on it.  For all intents and purposes, the file is invisible to the rest of the world.  Some files, such as those containing settings or passwords or temporary files, may be stored in the working directory, but you may not want to include them in version control.  If you want Git to start tracking a file, you have to explicitly tell it to do so with the **git add** command; once you do this, the status of the file changes to tracked.
-   **Unmodified**:  A tracked file in Git is included as part of the repository, and changes are watched.  This status means Git is watching for any file changes that are made, but it doesn't see any yet.
-   **Modified**:  Whenever you add some code or make a change to the file, Git changes the status of the file to modified.  Modified status is where Git sees that you are working on the file but you are not finished.  You have to tell Git that you are ready to add a change (modified) file to the index or staging area by issuing the **git add** command again.
-   **Staged**:  Once a changed file is added to the index, Git needs to be able to bundle up your changes and update the local repository.  This process is called staging and is accomplished through **git commit**.  At this point, your file status is moved back to the tracked status, and it stays there until you make changes to the file in the future and kick off the whole process over again.

If at any point you want to see the status of a file from your repository, you can use the extremely useful command **git status** to learn the status of each file in your local directory.

You can pull files and populate your working directory for a project that already exists by making a clone.  Once you have done this, your working directory will be an exact match of what is stored in the repository.  When you make changes to any source code or files, you can add your changes to the index, where they will sit in staging, waiting for you to finish all your changes or additions.  The next step is to perform a commit and package up the changes for submission (or pushing) to the remote repository (usually a server somewhere local or on the Internet).  This high-level process uses numerous commands that are covered in the next section.

&nbsp;

### **Using Git**

&nbsp;

Git may not come natively with your operating system.  If you are running a Linux variation, you probably already have it.  For Mac and Windows you need to install it.  You can go to the main distribution website (https://git-scm.com) and download builds for your operating system directly.  You can install the command-line version of Git and start using it.  There are GUI-based Git clients, but for the purposes of the DEVASC exam, you should focus your efforts on the command line.  Git commands come in two different flavors.  

-   The standard user-friendly commands are called "porcelain." 
-   The more complicated inner workings of Git manipulating commands are called "plumbing."

At its core, Git is a content-addressable file system.  The version control system part was layered on top to make it easier to use.  For the DEVASC exam, you need to know your way around Git at a functional level (by using the porcelain).  Most of the plumbing commands and tools are not ones you will be using on a regular basis and are not covered on the exam.

&nbsp;

### **Cloning/Initiating Repositories**

&nbsp;

Git operates on a number of processes that enable it to do its magic.  The first of these processes involves defining a local repository by using either **git clone** or **git init**.  The **git clone** command has the follow syntax:

&nbsp;

```
git clone (url to repository) (directory to clone to)
```

&nbsp;

If there is an existing repository you are planning to start working on, like one from GitHub that you like, you use **git clone**.  This command duplicates an existing Git project from the URL provided into your current directory with the name of the repository as the directory name.  You can also specify a different name with a command-line option.

&nbsp;

To create a completely new repository, you need to create a directory.  Luckily, **git init** can be supplied with a directory name as an option to do this all in one command:

&nbsp;

```
#git init newrepo
Initialized emtpy Git repository in /Users/chrijack/Documents/GitHub/newrepo/.git/

#newrepo git:(master)
```

&nbsp;

What you just created is an empty repository, and you need to add some files to it.  By using the **touch** command, you can create an empty file.  The following example shows how to view the new file in the repository with the directory (**ls**) command:

&nbsp;

```
#newrepo git:(master) touch newfile

#newrepo git:)master) ls

newfile
```

&nbsp;

Once the file is added, Git sees that there is something new, but it doesn't do anything with it at this point.  If you type **git status**, you can see that Git identified the new file, but you have to issue another command to add it to index for Git to perform version control on it.  Here's an example:

&nbsp;

```
# git status

On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
    (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

    newfile

nothing added to commit but tracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

&nbsp;

Git is helpful and tells you that it sees the new file, but you need to do something else to enable version control and let Git know to start tracking it.

&nbsp;

### **Adding and Removing Files**

&nbsp;

When you are finished making changes to files, you can add them to the index.  Git knows to then start tracking changes for the files you identified.  You can use the following commands to add files to an index:

-   **git add . or -A**:  Adds everything in the entire local workspace.
-   **git add (*filename*)**:  Adds a single file.

The **git add** command adds all new or deleted files and directories to the index.  Why select an individual file instead of everything with the **.** or **-A** option?  It comes down to being specific about what you are changing and adding to the index.  If you accidentally make a change to another file and commit everything, you might unintentionally make a change to your code and then have to do a rollback.  Being specific is always safest.  You can use the following commands to add the file newfile to the Git index (in a process known as *staging*):

&nbsp;

```
# git add newfile

# git status

On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
    (use "git rm --cached file>..." to unstage)

    new file: newfile
```

&nbsp;

Removing files and directories from Git is not as simple as just deleting them from the directory itself.  If you just use file system commands to remove files, you may create headaches as the index can become confused.  You can remove files and directories from Git, but it requires an extra step of adding the file deletion to the index (which sounds counterintuitive, right?).  The best way is to use the **git rm** command, which has the follow syntax:

&nbsp;

```
git rm (-r) (-f) (folder/file.py)
```

&nbsp;

This command removes a file or directory and syncs it with the index in one step.  If you want to remove a directory that is not empty or has subdirectories you can use the **-r** option to remove recursively.  In addition, if you add a file to Git and then decide later that you want to remove it, you need to use the **-f** option to force removal from the index.  This is required only if you haven't committed the changes to the local repository.  Here is an example:

&nbsp;

```
# touch removeme.py
# git add .
# ls 

newfile   removeme.py

# git rm -f removeme.py

rm 'removeme.py'
```

&nbsp;

**git mv** is the command you use to move or rename a file, directory, or symbolic link.  It has the follow syntax:

&nbsp;

```
git mv (-f) (source) (destination)
```

&nbsp;

For this command you supply a source argument and a destination argument to indicate which file or directory you want to change and where you want to move it.  (Moving in this case is considered the same as renaming.)  Keep in mind that when you use this command, it also updates the index at the same time, so there is no need to issue **git add** to add teh change to Git.  You can use the **-f** argument if you are trying to overwrite an existing file or directory where the same target exists.  The following example shows how to change a filename in the same directory:

&nbsp;

```
# ls

oldfile.py

# git mv oldfile.py newfile.py
# ls

newfile.py
```

&nbsp;

### **Committing Files**

&nbsp;

When you commit a file, you move it from the index or staging area to the local copy of the repository.  Git doesn't send entire updates; it sens just changes.  The **commit** command is used to bundle up those changes to be synchronized with the local repository.  The command is simple, but you can specify a lot of options and tweaks.  In its simplest form, you just need to type **git commit**.  This command has the following syntax:

&nbsp;

```
git commit [-a] [-m] <"your commit message">
```

&nbsp;

The **-a** option tells Git to add any changes you make to your files to the index.  It's a quick shortcut instead of using **git add -A**, *but it works only for files that have already been added at some point before in their history; new files need to be explicitly added to Git tracking*.  For every commit, you will need to enter some text about what changed.  If you omit the **-m** option, Git automatically launches a text editor to allow you to type in the text for your commit message.

Here is an example of the **commit** command in action:

&nbsp;

```
# git commit -a -m "bug fix 21324 and 23421"

[master e1fec3d] bug fix 21324 and 23421

1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

delete mode 100644 newfile
```

&nbsp;

> **Note**
> As a good practice, use the first 50 characters of the commit message as a title for the commit followed by a blank line and a more detailed explanation of the commit.  This title can be used through Git to automate notifications such as sending an email update on a new commit with the title as the subject line and the detailed message as the body.

&nbsp;

### **Pushing and Pulling Files**

&nbsp;

Up until this point you have seen how Git operates on your local computer.  Many people use Git in just this way, as a local version control system to track documents and files.  Its real power, however, is in its distributed architecture, which enables teams from around the globe to collaborate on projects.

In order to allow Git to use a remote repository, you have to configure Git with some information so that it can find it.  When you use the command **git clone** on a repository, Git automatically adds the remote repository connection information via the URL entered with the **clone** command.

When using the **git init** command, however, you need to make sure that you enter information to find the remote location for the server with the **git remove add** command, which has the following syntax:

&nbsp;

```
git remote add (name) (url)
```

&nbsp;

**git remote -v** cna be used to show which remote repository is configured.  The following example shows how to add a remote repository and then display what is configured.

&nbsp;

```
# git remove add origin https://github.com/chrijack/devnetccna.git

# git remote -v

origin  https://github.com/chrijack/devnetccna.git  (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/chrijack/devnetccna.git  (push)
```

&nbsp;

What if you make a mistake or want to remove remote tracking of your repository?  This can easily be done with the **git remote rm** command, which has the follow syntax:

&nbsp;

```
git remote rm (name)
```

&nbsp;

Here is an example of this command in action:

&nbsp;

```
# git remote rm origin

# git remote -v
```

&nbsp;

In order for your code to be shared with the rest of your team or with the rest of the world, you have to tell Git to sync your local repository with the remote repository (on a shared server or service like GitHub).  The command **git push**, which has the following syntax, is useful in this case:

&nbsp;

```
git push (remotename) (branchname)
```

&nbsp;

This command needs a remote name, which is an alias used to identify the remote repository.  It is common to use the name origin, which is the default if a different name is not supplied.  In addition, you can reference a branch name with **git push** in order to store your files in a separately tracked branch from the main repository.  (You can think of this as a repository within a repository.)  The sole purpose of the **git push** command is to transfer your files and any updates to your Git server.  This following is an example of the **git push** command in use:

&nbsp;

```
# git push origin master

Enumerating objects: 3, done.

Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.

Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 210 bytes | 210.00 KiB/s, done.

Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)

To https://github.com/chrijack/devnetccna.git

 * [new branch]      master -> master

Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'ori-
gin'.
```

&nbsp;

The command **git pull** syncs any changes that are on the remote repository and brings your local repository up to the same level as teh remove one.  It has the following syntax:

&nbsp;

```
git pull (remotename) (branchname)
```

&nbsp;

Whenever you begin to work with Git, one of the first commands you want to issue is **pull** so you can get the latest code from the remote repository and work with the latest version fo the code from the master repository.  **git pull** does two things:  

-   fetches the latest version of the remote master repository
-   merges it into the local repository

If there are any conflicts, they are handled just as they would be if you issued the **git merge** command, which is covered shortly.

Example of using the **git pull** command:

```
# git pull origin master
remote: Enumerating objects: 9, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (9/9), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
remote: Total 8 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (8/8), done.

 ### **Working with Branches**

&nbsp;

 Branches are an important workflow in software development.  Say you want to add a new feature to your software or want to fix a bug.  You can create a branch in order to add a separate development workspace for your project and prevent changes from destabilizing the main project (the master branch in Git).  Remember that Git keeps a running history of every commit you to make.  This history (called a ***snapshot*** in Git terminology) details all the changes to the software over time and ensures the integrity of this record by applying an SHA-1 hash.  This hash is a 40-character string that is tied to each and every commit.  The following is an example of three commits with a hash displayed using the **git log** command:

&nbsp;

 ```
 #git log

Author: Chris Jackson <chrijack@me.com>
Date:   Fri Oct 18 20:03:32 2019 -0500

    first commit
```

&nbsp;

Notice that the first entry is the current commit state, as it is referenced by HEAD.  The other entries show the chronological history of the commits.  

&nbsp;

To add a Git branch, you simply issue the **git branch** command and supply the new branch with a name, using the following syntax:

&nbsp;

```
git branch (-d) <branchname> [commit]
```

&nbsp;

You can alternatively specify a commit identified by a tag or commit hash if you want to access a previous commit from the branch history.  By default, Git selects the latest commit.  In addition, you can delete a branch when you no longer need it by using the **-d** argument.  The following example shows how to create a branch and display the current branches with the **git branch** command with no arguments:

&nbsp;

```
# git branch newfeature
# git branch

* master

newfeature
```

&nbsp;

The * next to **master** shows that the branch you are currently in is still master, buy ou now have a new branch named **newfeature**.  Git simply creates a pointer to the latest commit and uses that commit as the start of the new branch

In order to move to the new branch and change your working directory, you have to use the **git checkout** command, which has the following syntax:

&nbsp;

```
git checkout [-b] (branchname or commit)
```

&nbsp;

The **-b** argument is useful for combining the **git branch** command with the checkout function and saves a bit of typing by creating the branch and checking it out (switching to it) all at the same time.  This example moves HEAD on your local machine to the new branch:

&nbsp;

```
# git checkout newfeature

Switched to branch 'newfeature'
```

&nbsp;

Now you have a separate workspace where you can build your feature.  At this point, you will want to perform a **git push** to sync your changes to the remote repository.  When the work is finished on the branch, you can merge it back into the main code base and then delete the branch by using the command **git branch -d (branchname)**.

&nbsp;

### **Merging Branches**

&nbsp;

The merge process in Git is used to handle the combining of multiple branches into one.  The **git merge** command is used to make this easier on the user and provide a simple way to manage the changes.  It has the following syntax:

&nbsp;

```
git merge (branch to merge with current)
```

&nbsp;

In order to get the two branches merged, Git has to compare all the changes that have occurred in the two branches.

On the newfeature branch, you can issue the following commands to add the change to the index and then commit the change:

&nbsp;

```
git add .
git commit -a -m "new feature"
```

&nbsp;

Now the branch is synced with the new changes, and you can switch back to the master branch with the following command:

&nbsp;

```
# git checkout master

Switched to branch 'master'
```

&nbsp;

From the master branch, you can then issue the **git merge** command and identify the branch to merge with (in this case, the newfeature branch):

&nbsp;

```
# git merge newfeature

Updating 77f786a..dd6bce5

Fast-forward

    text1 | 1 +

    1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

&nbsp;

Notice that the output above says "Fast-forward"; this refers to updating past the changes in the branch, which is much like fast-forwarding through the boring parts of a movie.

&nbsp;

### **Handling Conflicts**

&nbsp;

Merging branches is a very useful capability, but what happens if the same file is edited by two different developers?  You can have a conflict in terms of which change takes precedence.  Git attempts to handle merging automatically, but where there is conflict, Git relies on human intervention to decide what to keep.  In the previous example, if there had been changes made to text1 in both the master branch and the newfeature branch, you would have seen the following message after using the command **git merge**:

&nbsp;

```
# git merge newfeature 

Auto-merging text1

CONFLICT (content):  Merge conflict in text1

Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

&nbsp;

Git would show that a line was added to text1 on the master branch and a line was added to text1 on the newfeature branch.  Git is letting you delete one or keep both.  You can simply edit the file, remove the parts that Git added to highlight the differences, and save the file.  Then you can use **git add** to index your changes and ***git commit** to save the local repository, as in the following example:

&nbsp;

```
# git add .
# git commit -m "merge conflict fixed"

[master fe8f42d] merge conflict fixed
```

&nbsp;

### **Comparing Commits with diff**

&nbsp;

The **diff** command is one of the most powerful Git tools.  It allows you to compare files and text to see which you want to use if there are multiple options.  The ability to compare specific commits in Git makes it easier to know what to keep and what to discard between two similar version of code.

The **diff** command takes two sets of inputs and outputs the differences or changes between them.  This is the syntax:

&nbsp;

```
git diff [--stat] [branchname or commit]
```

&nbsp;

**git diff** looks at the history of your commits, individual files, branches, and other Git resources.  It's a very useful tool for troubleshooting issues as well as comparing code between commits.  It has a lot of options and command-line parameters, which makes it a bit of a Swiss Army knife in terms of functionality.  One of the most useful functions of **diff** is to be able to see the differences between the three Git tree structures.  The following are variations of the **git diff** command that you can use:

-   **git diff**:  This command highlights the difference between your working directory and the index (that is, what isn't yet stage).
-   **git diff --cached**:  This command shows any changes between the index and your last commit.
-   **git diff HEAD**:  This command shows the difference between your most recent commit and your current working directory.  It is very useful for seeing what will happen with your next commit.

*Personal note:  Use ONLY **q+enter** to exit.*

The following is an example of executing **git diff --cached** after text2 is added to the index:

&nbsp;

```
#git diff --cached
diff --git a/text2 b/text2
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..b9997e5
--- /dev/null
+++ b/text2
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+new bit of code
```

&nbsp;

**git diff** identified the new file addition and shows the a/b comparison.  Since this is a new file, there is nothing to compare it with, so you see **--- /dev/null** as the *a* comparison.  In the *b* comparison, you see **+++ b/text2**, which shows the addition of the new file, followed by stacks on what was different.  Since there was no file before, you see **-0,0** and **+1**.  (The + and - simply denote which of the two versions you are comparing.  It is not actually a **-0**, which would be impossible.)  The last line shows the text that was added to the new file.

Another very useful capability of **git diff** is to compare branches.  By using **git diff (branchname)**, you can see the differences between a file in the branch you are currently in and one that you supply as an argument.  The following compares text1 between the branches master and newfeature, where you can see that line 3 is present on newfeature branch's text1 file:

&nbsp;

```
#git diff newfeature text1
 diff --git a/text1 b/text1
index 45c2489..ba0a07d 100644
--- a/text1
+++ b/text1
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
 line 1
 line 2
+line 3
 new feature code
 ```

 &nbsp;

 ## **Conducting Code Review**

 &nbsp;

***The intent behind a code review process is to take good code and make it better by showing it to others and having them critique it and look for potential errors.***

Beyond the aspects mentioned above, why should you conduct code reviews?  The following are a few common benefits of code review:

-   It helps you create higher-quality software.
-   It enables your team to be more cohesive and deliver software projects on time.
-   It can help you find more defects and inefficient code that unit tests and functional tests might miss, making your software more reliable.

The following are some good practices to help make your code review effective:

-   Use a code review checklist that includes organization-specific practices (naming conventions, security, class structure, and so on) and any areas that need special consideration.  The goal is to have a repeatable process that is followed by everyone.
-   Review the code, not the person who wrote it.  Avoid being robotic and harsh so you don't hurt people's feeling and discourage them.  The goal is better code, not disgruntled employees.
-   Keep in mind that ode review is a gift.  No one is calling your baby ugly.  Check your ego at the door and listen; the feedback you receive will make you a batter code in the long run.
-   Make sure the changes recommended are committed back into the code base.  You should also share findings back to the organization so that everyone can learn from mistakes and improve their techniques.
