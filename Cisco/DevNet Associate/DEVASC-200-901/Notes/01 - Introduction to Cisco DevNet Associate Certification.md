For over thirty years, the industry has thoguht of a network as a collection of devices such as routers, switches, and wireless components.  The shift in mindset to look at at a network as a holistic system is a more recent concept that stems from the advent of network controllers, which split role and functionality from one another.  This is often referred to as separating the control plane from the data plane.

At a high level, thte control plane is where all the instructions on a device live (for example, the routing protocols that exchange routing updates).  The data plane is where all the user or data traffic flowers (for example, the traffic between users on a network).  Having a controller that sitso n top of the rest of the devices makes it possible to operate the network as a whole from a centralized management point.

To put this in more familiar terms, think of the command-line interface (CLI_.  The CLI was not designed to make massive-scale configuration changes to multiple devices at the same time.  Software-defined networking (SDN) and controller capabilities are becoming areas of focus in the industry.  Controllers offer the ability to manage a network as a system, which means the policy management can be automated and abstracted.  They provide the capability of supporting dynamic policy changes rather than requiring manual policy changes and device-by-device configurations when something requires a change within the environment.

It is important from a career and skills perspective to adapt to the changes within the industry.  Keeping on top of new skillsets iscritical to maintaining relevance in the industry or job market.  Becoming Cisco certified helps with this for multiple reasons, including the following:
-   Highlighting skills to eployers
-   Highlighting skills to industry peers
-   Providing value to employers
-   Providing credibility
