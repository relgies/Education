#   **Question 4**

Which two URLs represent valid RESTCONF requests to a device running IOS-XE?  (Choose two.)

##  **Options**
-   **`https://192.168.1.100:443/restconf/data/Cisco-IOS-XE-native:native?content=config`**
-   `https://192.168.1.100:22/restconf/data/Cisco-IOS-XE-native:native?content=config`
-   **`https://192.168.1.100:830/restconf/data/Cisco-IOS-XE-native:native?content=config`**
-   `https://192.168.1.100:80/restconf/data/Cisco-IOS-XE-native:native?content=config`

##  **Correct Answer**

-   **`https://192.168.1.100:443/restconf/data/Cisco-IOS-XE-native:native?content=config`**
-   `https://192.168.1.100:80/restconf/data/Cisco-IOS-XE-native:native?content=config`

##  **Explanation**

RESTCONF runs over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) port 80 or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) over port 443.  A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) can specify a port number after the hostname or IP address, separated by a colon.  These two URLs represent valid RESTCONF requests to a device running IOS-XE:

`https://192.168.1.100:443/restconf/data/Cisco-IOS-XE-native:native?content=config`

`https://192.168.1.100:80/restconf/data/Cisco-IOS-XE-native:native?content=config`

RESTCONF is designed to provide REST-like Application Programming Interface (API) access to network device configurations.  When a controller or other network management system interacts with a device using RESTCONF, queries can be sent, responses received, and configuration information supplied using data encoded following either Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) conventions.

The URL `http://192.168.1.100:830/restconf/data/Cisco-IOS-XE-native:native?content=config` is not valid because it attempts to connect to port 830, the NETCONF Secure Shell (SSH) port.

The URL `http://192.168.1.100:22/restconf/data/Cisco-IOS-XE-native:native?content=config` is not valid because it attempts to connect to port 22, the SSH port.

> TLDR;
> <br>
> RESTCONF uses HTTP and HTTPS as well as XML and JSON.

An application attempts to update a Meraki network name.  Given the response in the exhibit, what is the most likely issue?

##  **Options**

-   Incorrect payload format
-   **Missing credentials**
-   Incorrect permissions
-   Incorrect syntax

##  **Correct Answer**

Incorrect permissions

##  **Explanation**

Incorrect permissions is the most likely reason the network name update fails.  the server is returning an HTTP 403 Forbidden response.  This indicates that the request was understood by the server, but the server is explicitly refusing to honor the request.  The most likely cause in this case is that the application making the request does not have the permissions required to update the network name.

Missing credentials is not the most likely reason the network name update fails.  The fact that the server returns HTTP 403 indicates that the request was authenticated.  If credentials were missing, the most likely response would be HTTP 401 Unauthorized.

Incorrect syntax is not the most likely reason the network name update fails.  The fact that the server returns HTTP 403 indicates that the request was understood, which would not be the case if the syntax were incorrect.  If the syntax were incorrect, possible responses include HTTP 400 Bad Request or HTTP 404 Not Found, depending on where the syntax error was in the request.

Incorrect payload format is not the most likely reason the network name update fails.  The API documentation indicates a content-type of JSON.  The request complies with this requirement by formatting the submitted network name using JSON.  If the payload format were incorrect, the most likely response would be HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type.

#   **Question 18**

Which gRPC component issues requests to an IOS XE device?

##  **Options**

-   **Service requestor**
-   Server
-   Stub
-   Method

##  **Correct Answer**

Stub

##  **Explanation**

The gRPC Remote Procedure Call (gRPC) stub component issues requests to an IOS XE device.  A remote procedure call (RPC) allows distributed application components to communicate as if they reside on the same machine.  ***In gRPC, the Stub (or client) makes requests to the gRPC Server.***

In a Cisco environment, gRPC provides a high-performance framework that facilitates low-latency communication between IOS XE devices and mobile applications.  gRPC remote procedure calls use the gRPC Network Management Interface (gNMI), which is a network management protocol used to install and manage a network device configuration.

The server component does not issue requests to an IOS XE device.  This component responds to requests from the gRPC stub.

The service requests component does not issue requests to an IOS XE device.  A service requester issues requests to REST APIs, but is not the same as a gRPC Stub.

The method component does not issue requests to an IOS XE device.  In programming languages, methods are used to encapsulate the code that will perform some action.

#   **Question 39**

Reorder the BASH commands in the answer area to complete the following steps, in order:

1.  Change to the home directory.
2.  Create an environment variable.
3.  Create a new file using the environment variable.
4.  List all files in a directory with details.
5.  Create a new directory.
6.  Copy the new file to the new directory.

##  **My Answer**

1.  cd ~
2.  touch $MYFILE
3.  export MYFILE=my_file
4.  ls -l
5.  mkdir my_dir
6.  cp my_file my_dir

##  **Correct Answer**

1.  cd ~
2.  export MYFILE=my_file
3.  touch $MYFILE
4.  ls -l
5.  mkdir my_dir
6.  mkdir my_dir
7.  cp my_file my_dir

##  **Explanation**

The cd~ command changes to the user's home directory.

The export MYFILE=my_file command creates an environment variable named MYFILE with a value of my_file.

The touch $MYFILE command creates a new file using the $MYFILE environment variable to name the file.

The ls -l command lists the files in the current directory, with details.

The mkdir my_dir command creates a new directory named my_dir.

The cp my_file my_dir command copies the file my_file to the directory my_dir.

#   **Question 45**

Which of the following is an important component of the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) process?

##  **Options**

-   **Constant deployment of new, production-ready code**
-   Change set batching prior to main branch integration
-   Extensive automated code testing prior to merging
-   Extensive application design and modeling prior to coding

##  **Correct Answer**

Extensive automated code testing prior to merging

##  **Explanation**

Extensive automated code testing prior to merging is an important component of the CI/CD process.  Such testing prevents major bugs from developing as code is continuously merged with the main branch.  The priamry goal of CI/CD is to use automation to continuously update and improve software.

Extensive application design and modeling prior to coding is not an important component of the CI/CD process.  Application design occurs prior to the CI/CD process.

Change set batching prior to main branch integration is not an important component of the CI/Cd process.  By its nature, continuous integration entails frequent merging of small change sets with the main branch.

Constant deployment of new, production-ready code is not an important component of the CI/Cd process.  Continuous deployment is a result of CI/Cd.  Continuous delivery means that functional code can be deployed at any time, but doing so is not a requirement or even a best practice.

#   **Question 57**

Which element is required in every POST request to the IOS XE REST API?

##  **Options**

-   A password
-   An explicit port
-   A JSON body
-   **An endpoint IP address**

##  **Correct Answer**

A JSON body

##  **Explanation**

A JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) body is required in every POST request to the IOS XE REST Application Programming Interface (API).  The JSON-formatted body provides the information that the POST requires to perform a requested action, including details about the action itself.

An explicit port is not required in every POST request to the IOS XE REST API.  A uniform Resource Identify (URI) often indicates the protocol that will be used in an API call, usually Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).  These protocols inherently use port 80 or 443 respectively.

An endpoint IP address is not required in every POSt request to the IOS XE REST API.  A URI, which is comparable to a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), is required because it provides a path to a target service endpoint.  URIs usually include a hostname that is resolved to an Internet Protocol (IP) address via Domain Name System (DNS).

A password is not required in every POST request to the IOS XE REST API.  Depending on how an API call is made, authentication is typically API-key or token based.  In any case, passwords should not be sent with POST requests.

&nbsp;

#   **Question 63**

Which authentication scheme will encode the username and password pair using Base64?

##  **Options**

-   **Authorization: Bearer \<username&password>**
-   Authorization: Basic \<username:password>
-   Authorization: Base64 \<username+password>
-   Authorization: APIkey \<username:password>

##  **Correct Answer**

Authorization: Basic \<username:password>

##  **Explanation**

Basic Authentication uses Base64 to encode colon-separated username and password pairs prior to transmission.  This information is provided in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) header in this format:

Authorization: Basic \<username:password>

Bearer Authentication, also known as Token authentication, does not send usernames or passwords and instead uses a bearer token.  Tokens are generated by an authentication service, such as OAuth.  this information is provided in the HTTP header in this format:

Authorization: Bearer \<bearer token>

Application Programming Interface (API) keys, also known as API Tokens, are typically generated by the API provider.  Public API keys may be shared, but private API keys, like passwords, should be protected.  API keys are provided in the HTTP header in several format, including:

Authorization \<API key>

Base64 is an encoding algorithm, not an authentication scheme.  Information encoded with Base64 is easily decoded.

Which statement indicates the start of the Cisco Webex HTTP response payload?

##  **Options**

-   **HTTP/1.1**
-   {"items":[
-   Content-Type:
-   "text":"Welcome!"

##  **Correct Answer**

{"items":[

##  **Explanation**

{"items":[ indicates the start of the Cisco Webex HTTP response payload.  Currently, the Webex API only supports returning data in the JSON format.  JSON consists of key-value pairs - double quoted elements separated by a colon and enclosed in curly braces.  The response payload is clearly delineated with a leading curly brace and contains several key-value pairs.  Another hint that indicates the payload data is the Conte-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8 entity header field.

HTTP/1.1 indicates the start of the response header.  Since the response code is HTTP 200 OK, the request was successful and includes body - or payload - content.

Content-Type: is an entity header that identifies the resource's media type - in this case, application/json.

"text":"Welcome!" is a JSON element in the response payload.  However, it does not indicate the beginning of the response payload.

&nbsp;

#   **Question 73**

Despite correct permissions, an API periodically returns HTTP 403 errors.  What is the most likely issue?

##  **Options**

-   **A user is not authorized.**
-   A rate limit has been exceeded.
-   A server certificate is invalid.
-   An API subscription has ended.

##  **Correct Answer**

A rate limit has been exceeded.

##  **Explanation**

A rate limit being exceeded is the most likely issue if an Application Programming Interface (API) periodically returns Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 403 errors.  While some Cisco APIs may return 403 errors for permission-related issues, the question states that the permissions are correct.  Therefore, it is likely that a rate limit has been exceeded.

An API subscription ending is not the most likely issue.  There is no specific error related to API subscriptions.

An invalid server certificate is not the most likely issue.  Error 400 Bad Request is the most likely error to be returned in the event of an invalid server certificate.

A user authorization issue is not the most likely issue.  This is especially true if the permissions are correct, as stated in the question.  Error 401 Unauthorized is the most likely error when a resource requires authentication and credentials are incorrect or missing.

#   **Question 77**

Which NETCONF command was used to generate this output?

```

                <netmask>255.255.255.0</netmask>
            </address>
        </ipv4>
        <ipv6 xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ip"/>
</interface>
```

##  **Options**

-   show run
-   POST
-   \<get-config>
-   **show ip interface**

##  **Correct Answer**

\<get-config>

##  **Explanation**

The \<get-config> NETCONF command was used to generate the XML-formatted output.  The NETCONF protocol is used to install, modify, and delete network device configurations.  NETCONF supports XML only, while RESTCONF supports both XML and JSON.  When a controller or other network management system interacts with a device using NETCONF, queries can be sent, responses received, and configuration information supplied using XML-encoded data.  NETCONF supports many built-in methods, including get-config, copy-config, and update-config.

The POST command was not used to generate the output.  This command is an HTTP method (command) and can be used by any protocol that supports HTTP as a transport protocol - including RESTCONF.  The HTTP POST method is used to create new data resources or update existing resources.  For example, RESTCONF could use the POST method to create a new resource on a device.

The show run command was not used to generate the output.  This command is used on router and switch CLIs to display the device's running configuration.

The show ip interface command was not used to generate the output.  This command is used on router and switch CLIs to display an interface configuration.

#   **Question 78**

Which approach to network security offers the greatest ease of use for clients while also protecting data in transit between clients and application servers?

##  **Options**

-   Install an X.509 certificate on the application server.  Require TLS.
-   Install a VPN system.  Restrict application access to VPN users.
-   Install a NAT gateway.  Configure the server with a private IP address.
-   **Install a federated authentication system.  Require users to authentication.**

##  **Correct Answer**

Install an X.509 certificate on the application server.  Require TLS.

##  **Explanation**

Installing an X.509 certificate on the application server and requiring TLS provides an easy-to-use method for protecting data in transit.  All modern browser and mobile apps provide built-in support for TLS connections and will automatically negotiate a secure connection as long as a valid certificate is provided, so no additional steps are required for client users.

Installing a VPN system would protect data in transit, but the system would have to be installed and configured, often at significant cost.  Additionally, most VPN systems require users to install a VPN client before connecting, so additional steps would be required of client users.

A federated authentication system could ensure that all clients are properly authenticated.  However, such a system would need to be installed and operated separately from the application.  Additionally, such a system would not guarantee security for all data in transit.

A NAT gateway would allow the application server to be configured with a private IP address, offering a minimal level of security.  However, NAT gateways do not necessary enforce protection for data in transit.

#   **Question 80**

Which concept limits an API to accepting only one request every minute?

##  **Options**

-   **Message throttling**
-   Sandboxing
-   Input validation
-   Fixed window

##  **Correct answer**

Fixed window

##  **Explanation**

Fixed windowing is an Application Programming Interface (API) concept that can be used to allow only one request every minute.  The fixed window algorithm specifies a per unit-of-time limit for each requestor.  For example, an API may specify that a client may only make 20 request every 303 minutes.  Any requests during that window that exceed the limit will be rejected.

Message throttling is not a rate limiting algorithm employed by APIs.  Flood control is one method of message throttling that is often used in anti-spam systems to limit the number of outbound messages a single client can send per given unit of time.

Input validation is not an API concept that can be used to allow only one request every minute.  Input validation is used to ensure that user-supplied data (in a web input form, for example) meets data type and structure requirements.  This is used not only to keep data valid, but also to help prevent malicious code from being sent to an application.

Sandboxing is not an API concept that can be used to allow only one request every minute.  DevNet Sandbox can be used to test code on live infrastructure.  Sandbox provides a variety of cloud-hosted Cisco platforms designed for learning, code experimentation, and testing.  This provides developers with a full development platform without the cost and time required to set up test environments in-house.  Additionally, Sandbox provides a suite of learning labs that provides step-by-step, hands-on instruction.

-d '{"roomId" : "d6qce5aLZkt6VLRD", "texT": "Welcome to Webex!"}'
```

##  **My Answer**

-   Return response headers
-   Follow redirects
-   HTTP request
-   Request header
-   Request payload

##  **Correct Answer**

-   Follow redirects
-   Return response headers
-   HTTP request 
-   Request header
-   Request payload

##  **Explanation**

curl is a command-line utility used to send or retrieve data using protocols such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), or File Transfer Protocol (FTP).  curl allows developers and testers to submit queries and post data to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), web sites, and other web-enabled services.  Its many options allow flexible and complex testing scenarios.

***The -L option specifies that curl should follow redirects.***

***The -i option specifies that curl should return response headers.***

***The -X option specifies the HTTP request.***  In this case, the HTTP POST to the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/messages.

***The -H option specifies extra header information that should be submitted with the request.***  This command includes two extra headers.  The first identifies the content-type sent to the server, in this case application/json.  The second header supplies an authentication token, without which the request will likely receive HTTP error 401 - Unauthorized.

***The -d option specifies the data to be included in the HTTP POST***, in this case the roomId and the message text that will be posted to the room.

A developer attempts to update a Webex room title to Conference Room 500 using the following command:

`https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/rooms/d6qce5aLZkt6VLRD?title='Conference Room 500'`

The command does not return an error, but the room title does not change.  What is the most likely cause?

##   **Options**

-   The API token was not specified.
-   A request body was not specified.
-   **The roomId is incorrect.**
-   Title must be enclosed in double quotes.

##  **Correct Answer**

A request body was not specified.

##  **Explanation**

THe most likely cause for the room title not changing is that a request body was not specified.  According to the API documentation, the new room title must be supplied as a body parameter, not as part of the URL.  Additionally, submitting the URL listed in the question would issue an HTTP GET, while the documentation stipulates that this updating a room requires an HTPT PUT.

For example, you could issue an HTTP PUT with the required body parameters using the following command:

```
curl --location --request PUT 'https://ciscospark.com/v1/rooms/d6qce5aLZkt6VLRD' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: applicaiton/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer 56e0lhqjaz827-ochh' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/plain'\
--data-raw '{
    "title": "Conference Room 500"
}'
```

The most likely cause for the room title not changing is not that the roomId is incorrect.  If this were tur,e the command would have returned an error.

The most likely cause for the room title not changing is not that the API token was not specified.  If this were true, the command would have returned an error.

The most likely cause for the room title not changing is not that the title must be enclosed in double quotes.  If this were true, the command would have returned an error.

#   **Question 88**

Using RESTCONF to interact with IOS-XE represents which type of management?

##  **Options**

-   **Controller-level**
-   Chip-level
-   Cloud-level
-   Device-level

##  **Correct Answer**

Device-level

##  **Explanation**

Using RESTCONF to interact with IOS-XE represents device-level management.  RESTTCONF provides API access to Cisco devices.  Centralized network management systems - or controllers - can use RESTTCONF with YANG models to query, modify, and delete device configurations.  When a controller or other network management system interacts with a device using RESTCONF, queries can be sent, responses received, and configuration information supplied using XML-encoded or JSON-encoded data.

Using RESTCONF to interact with IOS-XE does not represent controller-level management.  In DevNet architecture, controllers are the platforms that typically sit in a datacenter or in the cloud and facilitate management of the enterprise network.  These controllers are used to collect and analyze device data, apply network policies, and manage configuration for the entire network.

Using RESTCONF to interact with IOS-XE does not represent cloud-level management.  In DevNet architecture, many Cisco cloud-based platforms provide REST API access, but they do not use RESTCONF to do so.

Using RESTCONF to interact with IOS-XE does not represent chip-level management.  All networking hardware includes various chips, such as Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) that perform purpose-specific tasks.

#   **Question 89**

An application makes an asynchronous API call.  Which is the most likely next step?

##  **Options**

-   **The application pauses execution until the server issues a response.**
-   The application periodically issues GET requests to verify the call's status.
-   The server pauses execution until the application issues the next request.
-   The server returns an HTTP status code 401 requesting authentication.

##  **Correct Answer**

The application periodically issues GET requests to verify the call's status.

##  **Explanation**

After an application makes an asynchronous API call, the application will then periodically issue GET requests to verify the call's status.  Asynchronous API calls allow the application to make a call and continue execution while the server processes the call.  By issuing GET requests, the application can determine the status of the call, as needed.

The application will not pause executing until the server responds.  This describe a synchronous API call.

The server will not pause execution until the application issues the next request.  Instead, the server will process the call and notify the application when the execution is complete.

The server will not retune an HTTP status code 401.  If an API requires authentication, it will likely occur prior to any asynchronous calls.

Which of the following are principles of the Agile software development process?  (Choose two.)

##  **Options**

-   **Working software**
-   Detailed project planning
-   **Waste elimination**
-   Face-to-face communication
-   Comprehensive documentation

##  **Correct Answer**

-   **Working software**
-   Face-to-face communication

##  **Explanation**

Face-to-face communication communication and working software are both principles of the Agile software development process.  Agile is meant to be a flexible, customer-focused process that entails high levels of collaboration as software is developed organically.

Comprehensive documentation is not a principle of Agile software development.  Agile favors working software over comprehensive documentation.

Waste elimination is not a principle of Agile software development.  This is a principle of Lean software development.

Detailed project planning is not a principle of Agile software development.  This is typically an element of the waterfall software development model.

Which correction is required if the Python script returns:

{"message":"Unauthorized"}

##  **Options**

-   Fix the typo in my_headers.
-   Add an Ip address to my_tkn_uri.
-   **Base64 encode my_password.**
-   Convert my_access_token to XML.

##  **Correct Answer**

Fix the typo in my_headers.

##  **Explanation**

Fixing the typo in my_headers will allow the script to execute successfully.  The Intent API documentation specifies that the token obtained when this API is used must be assigned to the value x-auth-token, but this script incorrectly sets the value to x-auth-tokens.  Though it is only off by one letter, the 's' at the end of the 'tokens' renders the whole value invalid.

The incorrect line is: my_headers = {"x-auth-tokens": my-access_token}

The corrected line is: my_headers = {"x-auth-token": my_access_token}

Adding an Ip address to my_tkn_uri will not correct the script error.  The API requires an IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN).  The script supplies the latter as the variable my_dna_ctr.

Base64 encoding my_password will not correct the script error.  If you did this, my_tkn_req would return a Base64 encoded value when it is called.

Converting my"_access_token to XML will not correct the script error.  The API documentation specifies that the default Content-Type for the token is JSON, which the script requests via the code my_tkn_request.json()["Token"]

Which two elements are returned in this IOS-XE REStCONF query result?  (Choose two.)

##  **Options**

-   **MTU address**
-   Static route
-   **IP address**
-   MAC address

##  **Correct Answer**

-   **IP address**
-   MAC address

##  **Explanation**

The Media Access Control (MAC) address and Internet Protocol (IP) address are required in this IOS-XE RESTCONF query result.  This output is generated by RESTCONF query against a device running IOS-XE, which is an operating system that runs on Cisco devices.  The values that can retrieved by RESTCONF are outlined in a Yet Another Next Generation (YANG) model.  The YANG model for this device includes interface details.  The queried interface - GigabitEthern1 - has these settings.

MAC address ("phys address"): 00:ba:56:bb:e2:9a
IP address ("iipv4"): 10.10.10.11

The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) address is not returned in this IOS-XE RESTCONF query result.  The MTU defines the largest protocol data unit that a network or interface supports.  In this case, the MTU is 1500 bytes.

A static route is not returned in this IOS-XE RESTTCONF query result.  Route information for IOS-XE devices is exposed by a different YANG model.

What does the NX-OS on-box Python script shown below do?  (Choose two.)

```
>>> import cisco
>>> from cli import *
>>> int = cisco.Interface("Vlan106")
>>> int.set_ipaddress("192.168.1.1/24")
>>> int_data = json.loads(clid('show interface vlan106'))
>>> print(json.dumps(int_data, indent=4))
```

##  **Options**

-   **Creates a new interface named Vlan106.**
-   Sets the IP address to 192.168.1.1..24.
-   **Sets the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0.**
-   **Displays the configuration of the interface.**
-   Dumps the configuration to a file named import.

> Yes I misread and chose three.

##  **Correct Answer**

-   **Sets the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0.**
-   **Displays the configuration of the interface.**

##  **Explanation**

The script sets the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0 and displays the interface's configuration.  NX-OS is an operating system used on high-end Cisco Ethernet and storage area network (SAN) switches.  NX-OS supports a Bash shell and allows Python scripts to be run directly from the CLI.  Running scripts in this fashion is referred to as on-box.

The int = cisco.Interface("Vlan106") command selects the target interface - in this case, Vlan106.

The int.set_ipaddresS("192.168.1.1/24") command sets a 24-bit subnet mask, or 255.255.255.0.  This command also sets the interface's IP address to 192.168.1.1.

The int_data = json.loads(clid('show interface vlan106')) command and the print(json.dumps(int_data, indent=4)) command displays the interface's configuration.  The first command initializes the int_data variable to hold the show interface vlan106 command's output.  The print command then displays the output.

The script does not set the IP address to 192.168.1.1..24.  You would use /24 to indicate the bit-length of the binary mask, which in decimal is displayed at 255.255.255.0.

The script dose not create a new interface named Vlan106.  If the cisco.Interface command specifies an interface that does not already exist, the command throws an error.

The script does not dump the configuration to a file named import.
