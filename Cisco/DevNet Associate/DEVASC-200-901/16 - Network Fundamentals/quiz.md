    <li>What is the role of the Preamble field in the EThernet header?
        <ol type="a">
            <li>It is used as padding data to ensure that the frame has at least the minimum number of bytes for transmission.
            <li>It is used as padding data to ensure that the frame has 1500 bytes for transmission
            <li>It is used to ensure that the frame was transmitted without data corruption.
            <li>It is used to synchronize the signal between the sender and receiver.
        </ol>
    <br />
    <li>How many bits are in a MAC address?
        <ol type="a">

            <li>48 bits
            <li>32 bits
            <li>64 bits
        </ol>
    <br />
    <li>What happens to a data frame for which a switch doesn't have the destination MAC address in its switching table?
        <ol type="a">
            <li>It gets discarded.
            <li>It gets transformed into a broadcast data frame.
            <li>It gets sent back to sender as it cannot be switched.
            <li>It gets flooded out all the ports except the port on which it was received.
        </ol>
    <br />
    <li>What is the bit pattern in the first byte for Classic C IPv4 address?
